    "body": "@YazzyYaz I wrote that part as it is in ECIP-1000 because the process consists of multiple discussion channels. If you say calls somehow have privilege to reach decisions regardless of what happens anywhere else, then what if it contradicts to the decision we made on Discord channels, what if it contradicts to the decisions we made on mailing lists? \r\n\r\nThat's the reason why the actual consensus process in ECIP-1000 can overwrite decisions you reached in calls, and why calls are \"just for reference\".",
