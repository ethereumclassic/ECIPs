    "body": "good point @zmitton . I have two questions around this:\r\n1. you can't really know what the full hash rate of ASICs is at the beginning, what do exchanges do?\r\n2. you're assuming ASICs production will be linear when in reality it could be that we get first `N` ASICs produced and then `5*N` in a single batch which eliminates the guarantee you gave above. What happens in this case? (this becomes less of a threat over time of course)\r\n\r\nAlso, this strategy assumes you are the dominant chain for the sha3 algorithm. I don't believe you get dominance by being the first one because the main incentive miners have is making money, most of them prioritize this over which chain they mine (of course not all of them, but the majority of miners needs to do this to survive). In the long run, I think utility brings the real value and with the value comes the price and hence hash rate. I believe our hash rate dominance depends more on the utility than on the hashing algorithm.",
