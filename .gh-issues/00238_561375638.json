    "body": "From @bmann:\r\n\r\n> Hey @yaz -- a contributor code of conduct seems like a fine idea\r\nI'm reading up and think a couple of things\r\n> 1) non threaded discussion like Github Issuies or Discord chat is going to always be hard\r\n> 2) Figure out what you're trying to solve.\r\n> Do you want to clearly identify where to go for help? Great.\r\n> Even there, where that email goes and \"who decides\" is still going to be the issue\r\n> If this is being done in regards to current discussions -- then you should just figure out a resolution there -- rather than retroactively applying a code of conduct\r\n> Don't know enough about the current situation to say much more\r\n> For (1) might just be some tips\r\ne.g. If you are not replying to the post immediately preceding yours, try quote-replying and/or mention the name of the person you're replying to",
