    "body": "Anyways.... @bobsummerwill while an important discussion we're having here -- maybe we're diving down a tangential rabbit hole here. \r\n\r\n_Please let's use #225 to continue this conversation's thread._\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet's try to shift back to @sorpaas 's initial topic:\r\n\r\n__The issue with Aztlan is that without EIP-1884, it effectively left an account trie attack vector open. Most current clients do not have other protections currently other than increasing gas cost. The paper for the attack is actually public, meaning anyone who knows the method can do it. As the security analysis for Aztlan is inadequate, we should prepare for its issues properly.__\r\n\r\n... and @sorpaas -- Would you be willing to rename this Issue something like `Aztlan Fork without EIP-1884 leaves an account trie attack vector open` ? I think this is a really important critique and a more descriptive title can help garner attention.\r\n\r\n... **OR, maybe better,** rename this issue to have it replace #225, and open a new issue with original intentions of this one (before Bob and I derailed it :joy_cat: )... might help with legibility.\r\n",
