    "body": "> I assume this is probably more complicated to implement\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is true. However, you could reduce complexity by allowing both - an Ethash proof and a SHA3 proof - as valid block hash for a certain range of blocks without defining a ration.\r\n\r\nIn general, switching a consensus engine is unprecedented for EVM based chains as far as I know and all clients that have to implement it, would require some substantial work.",
