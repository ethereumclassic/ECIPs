    "body": "Just for some clarification and to avoid miss-information, saying EIPs\ncopied BIPs is incomplete. BIPs copied Python Improvement Proposals\ndirectly and Ethereum copied BIPs with almost no changes (ERC is the\nexception)\n\nThe Python system was designed for a very different ecosystem with very\ndifferent constraints. One notable example is the complete lack of\ndecentralization.\n\nFor what it is worth, the system hasn’t been reexamined from a principals\nand design perspective since the change of scenery.\n\nCheers,\nJames\n\n\nOn Fri, Nov 8, 2019 at 11:58 AM Bob Summerwill <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> @TokenHash <https://github.com/TokenHash> soc1c expressed a preference\n> for CC0.
