If not, we shouldn't discuss them\r\n- Bob: No proposals\r\n- Afri: EF network will act as a testnet for Classic with the upcoming Istanbul fork\r\n- Tomek: Best idea would be to have Aztlan without EIP 1884 and then have EIP 1884 with account versioning?\r\n- Wei: Yeah right, we would need a new specification\r\n- Afri: Shall we lock in Aztlan?\r\n- **Rough consensus on Aztlan without EIP 1884 (Yingchun flavor)**\r\n- Afri: Shall we add EIP 1884 plus account versioning in a subsequent hardfork?\r\n- Bob: Maybe new ECIP, doesn't necessarily have to be EIP 1884\r\n- Yaz: Do we need other tooling if we exclude 1884?\r\n- Bob: Not required\r\n- Wei: It's only gas assumptions. The correct answer is \"yes\" but the differences are only very slight.\r\n- Bob: Differences are slight anyways\r\n- Back and forth between Bob and Wei\r\n- Greg: Doesn't think the gas table affects compiler, we are probably good\r\n- Zac: Why is it in there?\r\n- Afri: Aztlan on mainnet March 2020, testnet in February 2020?\r\n- Yaz: Might break anything, so careful\r\n- Bob: Just be clear, we don't have to maintain any tooling\r\n- Greg also says something\r\n- Afri: Let's move Aztlan to last call? Testnets in February and decided block numbers offline?\r\n- _Silence..._\r\n- Afri: Is this \"don't care\" or \"rough consensus?\"\r\n- Cody: _Rough consensus..._\r\n- Wei: Just to be clear? Are we using ECIP 1072? How long should \"last call\" last?\r\n- Afri: Three weeks \"last call\" would be sufficient to evaluate Istanbul on EF network\r\n- Everyone: Sounds good\r\n- Afri: Any final comments?\r\n- Bob: Are we calling it Yingchun now?\r\n- Wei: No, let's stick with Aztlan\r\n- Yaz: We already communicated Aztlan\r\n- Afri: Let's call it Yingchun flavored Aztlan (ECIP 1061)\r\n- _Thanks everyone_\r\n",
