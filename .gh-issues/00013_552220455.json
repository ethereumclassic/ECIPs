    "body": "Even if it rises quickly, that's ok. It is a *drop* in hashpower that should be perceived as unhealthy. To get around this, the attacker would have to control the majority of new ASICs before they come online (not impossible but much more economic out-of-band commitment than the previous 51% attack).\r\n\r\nIn reality ASIC production does not come online all at once. Especially as hashrates stabilize this gets hard and harder because the supply of new unused ASICs is unlikely to dwarf current live hashpower.\r\n\r\n",
