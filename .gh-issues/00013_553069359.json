Though @prestwich's other comments regarding vulnerability to other Ethash pools remains valid regardless.\r\n\r\nOh, I mean that PoW assumes that, and only works if, the heaviest chain is expensive to make. And that assumption is not valid for ETC at the moment. So following the heaviest valid chain does not create a reliable consensus in ETC",
