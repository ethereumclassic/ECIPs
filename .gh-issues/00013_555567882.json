    "body": "@Wolf-Linzhi thanks for response, very interesting. So you're saying that memory-hard POW makes ASIC marketplace more competitive, as the source of the biggest efficiency gain (fast memory) is much more commoditized compared to the source of the biggest efficiency gain (5nm fabs) for compute-bound POW like sha256/sha3.\r\n\r\nIs this correct interpretation of your message? If that is indeed the case, then Ethash with DAG size limit starts to look more attractive.\r\n\r\nWould still like flyclients tho.",
