If existing gas costs are allowed to continue, DOS vector still exists.\r\n\r\n> In fact, I'm pretty sure all the DOS vectors so far discovered have been of this kind, fixed by changing gas costs. If this ECIP had been implemented, it would have had to have been overridden to change gas costs of already-deployed contracts.",
