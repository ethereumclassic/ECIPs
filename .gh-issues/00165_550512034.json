    "body": "A Crypto-Decentralist Manifesto\r\nJuly 11, 2016 by Arvicco\r\n\r\nhttps://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2016-07-11-manifesto/\r\n\r\nto which I'd like to highlight:\r\n\r\n**Openness is necessary**. It goes without saying that the rules of the game should be open for anyone to see and understand. **Anyone should be able to participate in any layer of the system without asking for any permission whatsoever**. Anyone should be able to use the network in accordance with its rules. Anyone should be able to create their own client implementing the open protocol. Anyone should be able to contribute to network security, and so on. **No registration, identification or other preconditions should limit participation. All such limitations prevent the network from scaling and their enforcement creates centralization risks.**\r\n\r\n**Neutrality is necessary**. It’s important for anyone participating in blockchain-enabled cooperation to be on an equal footing with everyone else. It doesn’t matter if you wield huge economic power or only a tiny amount. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a saintly Mother Theresa or a vicious drug dealer. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a human or a refrigerator. It doesn’t matter what you believe in, what political theory you subscribe to, or whether you’re a moral or immoral person. A participant’s ethnicity, age, sex, profession, social standing, friends or affiliations, make or model, goals, purposes or intentions — none of this matters to the blockchain even a bit. **The rules of the game are exactly the same for everyone, period.** Without neutrality, the system is skewed towards one set of participants at the expense of others. In that case, it’s less likely to gain universal acceptance and maximize network value for everyone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Bob started this ecip I felt a reference to ProgPoW would eventually come, as it did. There's private agendas hiding behind every single action and we must maintain our values truthfull to the ETC manifesto. \r\n\r\nDon't trust, verify. If you think a contributor may have bad intentions, review the contributions extra carefully. Not being anonymous is not a synonym for good intentions either.\r\n\r\nAlso, what would you do if someone \"signs\" as John Doe? Require a government issued ID? \r\n\r\n@TokenHash  thank you for standing ground to this attack on ETC values.",
