    "body": "Well, chances are if ETC is to live forever we'll have to change POW hashing function every 50 years or so. Might as well figure out the migration process now, so that when ETC stores billions of dollars and SHA3 gets considered insecure, there is an established path towards SHA4 migration that preserves monetary policy. Bitcoin will have to adapt too in time.\r\n\r\nYour gradual dual-hashing proposal is clever. The trick here is to balance different hashrates and difficulty adjustments without introducing unfortunate bugs. Need to learn from multi-algo coins' (e.g. XVG) mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut before we proceed we must come to terms with the fact that changing hashing algos is a necessary procedure, and migrating to SHA3 soon might be the best choice we have for the next 50 years.\r\n\r\nIf we miss this window and another coin adopts SHA3 faster we might have to wait until SHA4, and watch other chains enjoy security and flyclients.",
