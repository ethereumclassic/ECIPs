    "body": "there should only be one ecip: 1061, and we can update it to reflect the changes to the hard fork. Not sure why a second one was created. Doing so does not follow any ECIP process.\r\n\r\nIf this IS a process we want to follow then it will allow me to create 30 copy meta ECIPs for this next hard fork and DDoS the ECIP process as itâ€™s doing right now.\r\n\r\nAtlantis did not have 8 diff meta ecips for every possible combination, we talked through it and updated one ecip.\r\n\r\nWhy are we changing the process now? \r\n\r\n\r\n",
