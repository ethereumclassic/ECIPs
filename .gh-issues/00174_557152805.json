    "body": "@soc1c I think we have agreed to go forward with your 1076 process. The issue I see now (with the process), is that we now need approval of *all* the contentious EIPs before we can even _move forward_ with this *one* (as defined in the [\"tech stage\" section](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/blob/da1b5fc7cc7432ed3e561ea9bdf64896dfb517b0/_specs/ecip-1076.md#process)). \r\n\r\nSince we have agreed not to make activation automatic, I think we should make the small adjustment that we do steps 1 and 2 in parallel. This will also allow miners a longer time period for signaling.",
