    "body": "@soc1c \"Agharta is basically ready to be tested, why not just do it?\"\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix plan would see us having two parallel release plans, one of which would be exactly the same as the current Agharta plan, and one of which would include Instanbul as well.\r\n\r\nThe worry with the two-phase approach is that it is going to take us several months longer, but without actually giving us any more safety or certainty.   Because the critical path here is going to be human consensus - not the technology.\r\n\r\nIf we don't have ETC mainnet with Agharta until March, and then have another HF for the Istanbul changes STARTING IN MARCH then we will likely will not complete that for another 6 months, right?   So maybe September 2020?\r\n\r\nBut the reality is that we could make Constantinople + Instanbul supporting ETC clients for for Parity and MultiGeth today as well.   Yes, it is a slightly moving target and would need to be kept refreshed as ETH keeps moving, but we could do it.\r\n\r\nGetting both streams of technical work going now would mean we have long-running testnets for each (POW and POA for each, for 4 testnets in today), and get great certainty - while we work on the human consensus.\r\n\r\nI think that we are still likely to ship as two HFs, but I want to start on the second HF now - not wait for months before even starting.\r\n\r\nI think we can hit the first HF way before March, and I think we can hit the second HF way before September.\r\n\r\nFor Parity and MultiGeth, we are mainly just enabling codepaths which already exist.   We don't have the challenges of ETH in having to invent the protocol changes and implement them all intermixed with the human consensus.\r\n\r\nBarring for EIP-1702 and EIP-615, which I guess would likely hit the second HF.\r\n",
