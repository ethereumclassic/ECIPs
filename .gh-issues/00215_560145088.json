Afri?\r\n\r\nEven if neither of you are there, I think we need this meeting.    Perhaps it is even better WITHOUT both of you there, because the meeting is really for the good of people on the outside looking in and thinking \"WTF!   So are we cool here?   Are we in the middle of a civil war?   Is there doing to be a contentious fork here?   I thought we were catching up on ETH protocol and having a majestic Phoenix from the flames moment.   Is everything just going to be a disaster instead?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer to all of those is NO.    But we could use that affirmation in a meeting, I think.   Recorded.  Minuted.  Reported on.\r\n\r\nMaybe @YazzyYaz can host?   Or I can host?   See also #233.",
