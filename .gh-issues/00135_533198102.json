    "body": "After checking from the ECIP sponsor @realcodywburns and some others in the ecosystem, I am proposing to add to the agenda a discussion about ECIP-1043: http://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1043\r\n\r\nI cannot comment on its technical merit or risks (leave that to devs) but the rationale \"the DAG has failed at its task and now only serves as a deterrent to broader investment in application specific hardware by competent distributors\" if true, is logical and would make mining more open and competitive in ETC among other benefits.\r\n\r\n",
