    "body": "### REJECT\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\n### The motivations are not probable arguments that Sha3 is needed.\r\n\r\n> A response to the recent double-spend attacks against Ethereum Classic. Most of this hashpower was rented or came from other chains, specfically Ethereum (ETH). A seperate proof of work algorithm would encourage the development of a specialized Ethereum Classic mining community, and blunt the ability for attackers to purchase mercenary hash power on the open-market.]\r\n\r\nProof of Work consensus is based on the 51% consensus rule. Therefore, this reaction offers no solution and the authors and champions of this proposal have a footprint of not believing this motivation.\r\n\r\n> As a secondary benefit, deployed smart contracts and dapps running on chain are currently able to use keccak256() in their code. This ECIP could open the possibility of smart contracts being able to evaluate chain state, and simplify second layer (L2) development.\r\n\r\nIt sounds expensive and largely not an in-demand feature. You can evaluate an EVM-based blockchain with traditional analytic libraries and software.\r\n\r\n### The rationales are not probable arguments that Sha3 is needed.\r\n\r\n> A CPU-intensive algorithm like Keccak256 would allow both the uniqueness of a fresh PoW algorithm that has not had ASICs developed against it, while at the same time allowing for organic optimization of a dedicated and financially commited miner base, much the way Bitcoin did with its own SHA256 algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis is equity and security theatre similar to my ProgPoW arguments https://medium.com/@stevan.blog/progpow-is-not-only-shady-its-baloney-opinion-60b2a6570b1c. The author has stated concern for cheap hardware being rented for malicious intentions. This totally contradicts their concerns by putting us back to cheap hardware. Forks to bully ASICs is not sustainable - we're not Monero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
