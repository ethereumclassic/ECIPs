    "body": "@BelfordZ The alternative is not 'doing nothing' and nobody wants a lawsuit. I think it is agreed, even ECIP-1000 expresses it, that all ECIPs need to have a license. \r\n\r\nThe list of licenses are five options, Apache 2.0 included, extensible with eight more as \"not recommended, but acceptable\".\r\n\r\nAs establishing one of those, Apache 2.0, as a root license in the repo would restrict the list to only one, the question is if it is absolutely necessary to do that or if it a \"nice to have\".\r\n\r\nAnother way of asking is are all the licenses in ECIP-1000, except Apache 2.0, all bad and risky options both for contributors and users? If so, can you cite the sources of that opinion?\r\n\r\nPS: and I am volunteering to seek authors and add licenses to all existing 41 ECIP retroactively, going forward editors can enforce that all have to have one as well. ETC can even explicitly say it has a preference for Apache 2.0, but not necessarily eliminating all other options in ECIP-1000.",
