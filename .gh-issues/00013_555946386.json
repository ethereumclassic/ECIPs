    "body": "@saturn-network \r\n\r\n> So you're saying that memory-hard POW makes ASIC marketplace more competitive\r\n\r\nYes. Bitmain is much smaller than Nvidia, came out with the Bitmain E3, had some success but wasn't able to displace Nvidia. Now Linzhi is trying, even smaller than Bitmain, and we'll see how that goes. A compute-bound PoW is nothing like this.\r\n\r\n> as the source of the biggest efficiency gain (fast memory) is much more commoditized compared to the source of the biggest efficiency gain (5nm fabs) for compute-bound POW like sha256/sha3.\r\n\r\nYes, but let's try to make it even more real. I think a potential future ETC SHA3 market is too small for 5nm, even 7nm, due to cost and also cycle time. For a 12/16nm double-SHA3 miner, estimate half the performance of a double-SHA256 miner, so let's say 20 TH. Who can make a 20 TH sha3 miner?\r\nWhen market size grows, the effect will be more pronounced. In a sha3 market the size of today's Ethash market, the concentration would be extreme. You would never see a 10 person company like Linzhi be able to (we will see about the result) compete with a company the size of Bitmain, let alone Nvidia. That is only possible due to memory.\r\n\r\nThere is also the size of the efficiency gain:\r\n\r\nA Bitmain E3 is 5x a GPU (in Ethash), but a Bitmain S17 is 10,000x a GPU (in sha-256) - (numbers simplified)\r\nHow can that be? Also: How can someone not have an idea why that is so, and still talk about security?\r\n\r\n> Ethash with DAG size limit starts to look more attractive.\r\n\r\nI made a case earlier of problems associated with any PoW change. From the options being discussed, the DAG size limit is the most careful modification and even an ASIC (immutability) maximalist will eventually soften. But you are still harming people who chose a 6 GB or 8 GB GPU over a 4 GB GPU, in addition to breaking more conceptual/principled things that go along with any PoW change. It is an irregular verification transition in the end.\r\nNakamoto said \"nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone\".\r\nIs this still true after limiting the DAG size? (I'm not sure, gotta run...)\r\n\r\n> Would still like flyclients tho.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants real innovation. Are flyclient and Ethash actually antagonists? Has implementation started?\r\nThe Ethash DAG and cache are deterministic, and can be precomputed for - let's say, 10 years. Merkle roots and proofs can do the rest?\r\nI don't think it's sustainable to start over every time you hit an unintended consequence of a decision made in the past, because today's decisions will also have unintended consequences in the future. That's what backward compatibility is for.\r\n\r\nThe real innovation coming out of the memory in Ethash (without breaking anything), is to put fast risc-v cores into that memory so that the miner can double-duty zk-proofs and other useful blockchain tasks.\r\n\r\nHappy chatting! Thanks for your questions and attention!",
