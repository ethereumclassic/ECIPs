    "body": "The asymmetry between mining and verifying is still problematic (too low). It has the same issue as Ethash: Extremely expensive verification (compared to sha256, for instance). This is because of a pseudo-random changing of params per epoch (every ~5 days). This prevents the ability to have a   [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) for verification. Verification requires a much more expensive _context_: The full historic datasets that resulted in particular epoch params.",
