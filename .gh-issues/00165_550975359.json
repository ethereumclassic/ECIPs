    "body": "IF ITS NOT BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT. \r\n\r\nETC development has successfully used this process, modeled after Bitcoin's BIP, since inception. Why are these topics, and concerns great enough to create such a proposal just now coming up? \r\n\r\nAs a long time active contributor, I dissent from this proposal and hope others will come to understand the likely negative repercussions that this proposal may have on this open source blockchain project as a whole, and not just _ protecting users [**developers, contributors**] from the very real threat of copyright and patent lawsuits._ \r\n\r\nFrom the ETC Decentralist Manifesto \r\n\r\n> Anyone should be able to create their own client implementing the open protocol. Anyone should be able to contribute to network security, and so on. **No registration, identification or other preconditions should limit participation. All such limitations prevent the network from scaling and their enforcement creates centralization risks.**\r\n\r\n",
