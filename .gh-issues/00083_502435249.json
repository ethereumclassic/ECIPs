    "body": "Just for the record, this was the proposal from the last call that was _almost_ accepted:\r\n\r\n1. Testing on [Kensington](https://github.com/eth-classic/kensington) (block `100)`, [Kotti](https://github.com/goerli/testnet#meta-data-kotti-classic) (block `716_617`), Morden (block `4_729_274`) continues as agreed upon in the previous call.\r\n2. We commit to a testing deadline roughly around `July 28th, 2019` which we use to evaluate the status and maturity of Atlantis.\r\n3. If there are no major problems discovered in that testing period, we commit to activating Atlantis on mainnet with a target in September around block `8_750_000`.\r\n\r\nWe can use this as the starting point of the discussion (maybe).\r\n",
