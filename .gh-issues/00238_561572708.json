    "body": "@sorpaas since it's not explicitly stated in the ECIP-1000, you can't say that community can't reach a decision in a call since no violation of the ECIP-1000 occurs. \r\n\r\n> You cannot, however, just say you \"reached a decision\" on the call and use that as the argument to move forward ECIPs. The call does not have that privilege.\r\n\r\nThat's provably false based on the ECIP-1000 mentioning that development calls have that privilege.\r\n\r\nYour other point is:\r\n\r\n> To me that means it's \"just for reference\".\r\n\r\nwhich contradicts the ECIP-1000:\r\n\r\n> Such a proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development calls, Discord channel, other groups or the mailing list\r\n\r\nRough consensus means a development call can be used to make a decision about an ECIP that's non-hardfork related according to ECIP-1000.",
