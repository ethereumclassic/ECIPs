I'm more than willing to offer my support, though I think \"smarter / technical people\" or actual devs would be more suited to review individual proposals. ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\nI have no issue planning and organizing these essential meetings i.e. meeting agenda, coordinate a suitable time with participants and confirm they'll be there, taking notes, watching the clock, keeping the meeting on track etc. \r\n\r\nWhenever you need me, I'll be there. I'll be around. ðŸŽµ ",
