    "body": "> Basically getting certainty that no legal claims could be launched in the future.\r\n\r\nAgainst whom?\r\n\r\n> The source code for Geth and all downstreams has unknown provenance. We do not know the full set of authors and there is zero defence there against future IP claims. Patent trolling, etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe 11k+ commits and years worth of available surrounding Github metadata (at least), might suggest a notion a _little less_ boisterous than \"unknown provenance\" and \"zero defense\"...  \r\n\r\nAre you a lawyer? Have you spoken with one or have documentation from a lawyer about the claims you're making here? Why haven't the patent trolls already taken over? And again, _whose_ interests are we protecting here against these alleged inevitable patent troll lawsuits? IBM's?\r\n ",
