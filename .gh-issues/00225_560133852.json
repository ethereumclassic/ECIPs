    "body": "\"Why haven't the patent trolls already taken over?\"\r\n\r\nProgPOW is perhaps the first major play to do just that.    I hope to goodness that there are not any \"submarine patents\" which already made it into Ethereum or ETC protocol or into Geth, but we just do not know.\r\n\r\nWhat SHOULD have happened in 2016 is that the Geth team should have gone through the process which I did for cpp-ethereum over several tedious months to establish provenance and consent, even with the license remaining as LGPLv3 / GPLv3.    Of course that did not happen, because \"Duty of Care\" is a foreign language to the EF.\r\n\r\nhttps://bobsummerwill.com/2016/07/12/c-re-licensing-plan/\r\n",
