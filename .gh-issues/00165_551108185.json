    "body": "> IF ITS NOT BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT.\r\n\r\nIT IS BROKEN! We got no licenses on ECIPs which is what we are fixing. BIPs have licenses but are a mess and scattered.\r\n\r\nIf the whole idea is that \"BTC doesn't do it, so we shouldn't\" then it's terrible reasoning. We follow the BTC conservative model, but it doesn't mean every part of BTC is good. Look at the centralization of BIP access as an example we should never adopt.\r\n\r\nApache license protects openness and permissionlessness. It's why all the developers who have experience agree with it in this thread and it's only the nondevs who are against licensing.\r\n\r\nThe quote about openness from  the ETC Manifesto by arvicco commits the Permissionless Fallacy. You can't be for both unrestricted openness while championing that we shouldn't commit the permissionless fallacy. Both are at odds with one another. \r\n\r\nAn open society should stop anything that makes it less open. Same with a permissionless system. APACHE license protects openness.\r\n\r\nIf you are angry about DCO and Anonymity, that's understandable but isn't part of this thread. Let's isolate those issues and debate them one by one for clarity.\r\n\r\nI like to fight as much as the next guy but fighting for no reason anytime someone proposes something is getting old.",
