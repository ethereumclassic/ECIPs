    "body": "@pyskell thanks for the explanation of the idea. I have a different kind of question regarding \r\n> It's vitally important to stick to pre-agreed rules when they're defined. In this case gas limit is a rule that governs computational size of transactions and there was no bound on physical data/contract size.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering what happens if the initial design of Ethereum is 'flawed'. I personally believe that some things are 'flawed' (though I'm open to being convinced otherwise) like for example:\r\n\r\n1. I believe we should limit the block size to have a guarantee that the chain size is able to scale (on L1) in a slow enough way so that majority can actually run it for the next decades\r\n\r\n1. I also think that having 15 second blocks isn't really beneficial for a store of value coin because you will always need more than 1 confirmation (reasoning from the fact that security is a function of time & energy, not the number of blocks). So we're basically just adding block headers for no good reason - I could be missing stuff here (actually there is one benefit that I know of, which is that you can gather the statistical data on the fly about things included in the block header, but I don't think this is used yet)\r\n\r\n\r\nDo we say these rules are pre-agreed and that we MUST stick to them?\r\n\r\n\r\nBtw, regarding the proposal from pyskell. I'm still slightly more in favor for a hard cap, but we could try the soft fork solution to see if it catches on and we could do a hard cap later on if needed. Assuming pyskell solution has no attack vectors and that the miners do adopt it, how much harder does this make it for devs?",
