    "body": "@zmitton \r\nI think the DAG layer is really simple instead, but is my opinion.\r\n\r\nI think we may agree that \"ASIC resistance\" is not equal to \"ASIC proof\".\r\nGiving the latter is utopia (provided there are enough incentives) I think ethash is still the best \"ASIC resistant\" algo out there: efficiency increases (nowadays) are stil in the range of less than two digits. Its resistance is inversely proportional to on-die memory cost for ASICs. That's it.\r\nThat's why for ethereum has been proposed an alterative (which I won't mention) to further increase memory hardness.\r\n\r\n\"Dormant\" hashpower is not an issue imho and don't think is enough to vector an attack given the fact is still predominantly GPU (yet not for long).\r\n\r\n",
