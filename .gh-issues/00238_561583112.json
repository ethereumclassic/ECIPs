    "body": "@YazzyYaz I mean, that's clearly an attempt to subvert the ECIP-1000 process. I wrote ECIP-1000, so I understand perfectly that nothing in it mentions that calls are the \"canon\" consensus process. That's not \"my own interpretations\".\r\n\r\nFeel free to arrange calls, but please also understand that you can't ignore other discussions channels. Otherwise, as mentioned, ECIP-1000 process is multi-channel, so what happens in other channels may and can overwrite \"decisions\" you reached in calls.",
