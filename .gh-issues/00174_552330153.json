    "body": "Wanted to mention an idea for switching algos inspired by grin.\r\n\r\nInstead of having one specific block to do an instant switch, which could have weird economic, security and centralization implications (especially if miners are developing ASICs in secret waiting for a 'new algo switch block'), it might be safer to do a gradual switch over the course of X blocks.\r\n\r\nFor example;\r\n\r\n- 10/10 blocks Ethash (now)\r\n- *initialize algo change*\r\n- 9/10 block Ethash, 1/10 blocks SHA3 (for 100,000 blocks)\r\n- 8/10 block Ethash, 2/10 blocks SHA3 (for 100,000 blocks)\r\n- ...\r\n- 1/10 block Ethash, 9/10 blocks SHA3 (for 100,000 blocks)\r\n- *algo switch complete* (total 1M blocks)\r\n- 10/10 blocks SHA3 (going forward)\r\n\r\nI assume this is probably more complicated to implement, but it provides some safety features (and gives time to fork if something goes wrong with the new algorithm)",
