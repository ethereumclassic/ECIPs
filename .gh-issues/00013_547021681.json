    "body": "@p3c-bot \r\n\r\n> The concern is that right now, Ethash is so poorly documented, only 1 or 2 companies knows how to build a profitable ASIC for it.\r\n\r\nThe \"lack\" of documentation for ethash is pure fallacy.\r\nThe algorithm is as well documented as it relies on the same SHA3: thus if enough documentation on SHA3 then enough documentation on ethash where the \"only\" addition is DAG (generated also using SHA3) and DAG accesses.\r\nIts all described here https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash\r\n\r\nAnyone with basic programming skills can build a running implementation in the language they prefer.\r\n\r\nASIC makers never had problems in \"understanding\" the algo (which also has a widely used open-source implementation here https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) and there is no \"secret\" behind. The problem of ASICs has always been how to overcome the memory hardness barrier: but this has nothing to do with the algo itself rather with how ASICs are built.\r\n\r\nP.s. Before anyone argues about SHA3 != Keccak256 please recall that Keccak allows different paddings which do not interfere with cryptographic strength of the **function**. SAH3 and Keccak246 (in ethash) are same keccak with different paddings.",
