    "body": "sha3 is more efficient to implement in asics. also, sha3 is faster than blake2b.\r\n\r\n>  ASIC implementations of BLAKE can process about 12.5 GB/s, compared to Keccak, which can process about 44 GB/s. An ASIC implementation of BLAKE2 would be probably about 40% faster than a similar implementation of BLAKE, i.e. around 17.5 GB/s.\r\n\r\nSee also https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/31677",
