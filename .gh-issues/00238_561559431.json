    "body": "@sorpaas SHA3 and ProgPoW weren't added to any Hardfork Meta, even if discussing them would mean having a Hardfork in the future if accepted. The discussion was purely about the ECIPs themselves.\r\n\r\nI disagree that non-hardfork calls are only for reference. Having said that, I understand this is just a Meta ECIP and doesn't necessarily warrant a call per se, but again reserve the right to follow the wishes of the community.",
