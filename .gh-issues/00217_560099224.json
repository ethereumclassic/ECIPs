    "body": "Oh, and [`3. Governance`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/217#issuecomment-559881215) -- what was the solution for that which supposedly existed in 2016 for Ethereum that would have been (according to you) agreeable to IBM? The Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum)? [EthSuisse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum_(company))? \r\n\r\nAnd...\r\n\r\n> Three reasons why IBM created Fabric:\r\n> [...]\r\n> IBM had a 30 engineer team ready to pile onto cpp-ethereum when the relicensing was done. Never happened\r\n> https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/217#issuecomment-559881215\r\n\r\nCan you cite a source for IBM's decision making process here that isn't [a cameo for Hyperledger](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hyperledger-project-reflects-blockchain-politics-1603381) ([a legal entity](https://www.hyperledger.org/trademark-usage), which[ ETC Cooperative recently announced being an \"Associate Member\" of](https://bobsummerwill.com/2019/11/20/etc-cooperative-joins-hyperledger/)).\r\n\r\n(Noting that the only occurrence of the word \"IBM\" in your https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hyperledger-project-reflects-blockchain-politics-1603381 link is:\r\n\r\n> So when you use Hyperledger you don't have to worry about patent risk from IBM, from DTCC, or anyone else on the projects they participate in.\r\n\r\n)",
