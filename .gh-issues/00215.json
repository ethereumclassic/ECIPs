Will use/create a voice channel _ad hoc._\r\n\r\nMeeting Coordinator: TBD\r\n\r\n### Agenda\r\n\r\n- Aztl치n Upgrade (Yingchun Edition) ([ECIP-1061](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1061)) is in _\"Draft\"_ state\r\n  - In the [Nov 27 meeting](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/177) we agreed on scope for Aztl치n Upgrade (= Istanbul - 1884)\r\n  - There was agreement that we should move forward with [ECIP-1072](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1072)\r\n  - However, members in the community, such as Afri, have done actions which violated the common editing protocol, such as [dismissing other editors' review without reason](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/199#event-2837816513).\r\n  - This has resulted in intensive community reactions, with Afri, Shane and Bob supporting reverting the previous community consensus (ECIP-1072) and move back to ECIP-1061, while others, such as Wei, @phyro, @TheEnthusiasticAs insisted on continuing on with ECIP-1072.\r\n  - Wei concluded that this is basically a contentious hard fork, due to community fight, and decided to implement it in `multi-geth` as a contentious hard fork.\r\n- Bob's recommendation\r\n  - Confirm in this call that there is no contention (except Wei).\r\n  - Confirm to move [ECIP-1061](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1061) to  **Last Call** (#199)\r\n  - Confirm to move [ECIP-1072](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1072) to **Rejected** (#218)\r\n  - Better yet would be for Wei to move [ECIP-1072](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1072) to **Withdrawn** himself, but that does not seem likely (#212)\r\n\r\nThis is the full scope of the agenda.  We won't add any items to this call.  Laser focus.",
