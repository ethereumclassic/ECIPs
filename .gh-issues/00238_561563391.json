    "body": "@YazzyYaz Any hard fork meta is technically \"purely ECIPs\". What matters is the type and format of the discussions. As you said, sha3 and ProgPoW was discussed in the bases that they want to get applied on Ethereum Classic mainnet in the future, and thus it was a hard fork discussion.\r\n\r\nI understand that you reserve the right to hold calls, but I hope you also understand that ECIP-1000 reserves the right to follow the wishes of the community based on written-form discussions, which may and can overwrite \"decisions\" reached in calls.",
