    "body": "Thanks, @developerkevin!\r\n\r\nSo I have added you in as the host.   Please could you publicize the meeting too?    The BEST way now would be for you to author a blog post within the new EthereumClassic.org website.\r\n\r\nThat means authoring a single MD file, like these:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ethereumclassic.github.io/commit/c0eb2658e74cdd6b2ebb56d12aff6bfbd2770c51\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ethereumclassic.github.io/commit/46622f7943f51646d1dbee2480a3ad84749f2599\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ethereumclassic.github.io/commit/e2c9f38b2b17ce526255cb9fcebb0d665aa3fec0\r\n\r\nInto ...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereumclassic/ethereumclassic.github.io\r\n\r\nSo you are literally just dropping a new MD file into 'pages/blog' folder of 'source' branch.\r\nIf you want to add images too, just drop (preferably PNG) images into 'pages/assets'\r\n\r\nand then you can reference them in the MD files like this:\r\n\r\n`![Bob and Yaz](../../assets/bob_and_yaz.jpeg)`\r\n\r\nTo preview you can run Node locally, as per the instructions in the readme, or you can just submit your PR, and wait on the automated builds to give you a preview URL.   @hitchcott can, no doubt, help you with any issues, or just ask on the #ethereumclassicwebsite channel on Discord.",
