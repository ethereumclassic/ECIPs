    "body": "Regarding signaling -- I don't think we even have any \"rough consensus\" of ECBP-1076 yet. There're several alternative proposals, which IMO is much better in many retrospective in terms of automation and process. For example, ECIP-1022 https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1022 and 36-STATEVOTE https://specs.that.world/36-statevote/\r\nThere're also many unresolved issues -- for example, even if we go all in for MINERVOTE, there's still the issue that the vote signaling will always be using the old mining algorithm, which is, in some sense, biased.",
