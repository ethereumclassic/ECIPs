If we follow the process strictly, the author will first name the spec `ECIP-description-of-functionality.md`. The editors will then assign a number to the ECIP, and change the filename.\r\n\r\nIn practice it's mostly alright if we just let the author of the ECIP to assign the number by him/herself -- EIP uses the number same as the Github PR number, and for ECIP we previously use the next available one. I will update this ECIP to reflect this.",
