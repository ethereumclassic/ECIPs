    "body": "@prestwich good points, I would add that the argument of having a hash function where specialized hardware dominates as opposed to a general GPU is valid IMO. If you allow GPUs to mine and they create a large portion of your hash rate, you can't really give a good estimate as to what the maximum hash rate could be. Sure, you can never estimate this correctly, but given that GPUs are used for gaming, there's a lot of power that could go to mining that is currently 'offline'. The same is not true if specialized hardware dominates.",
