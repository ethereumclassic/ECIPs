    "body": "Im not sure its been mentioned, but this would make anyone looking to develop a new EVM would need to implement all previous versions as well.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we must be prudent to ensure that changes are very well documented, and the implementation of each version can be replicated by following this documentation with relative ease.\r\n\r\nWe should hold off on including this ECIP until the following are very well defined:\r\n\r\nWhat will be the canonical model for describing the EVM\r\nIn what format will changes to this model be proposed\r\nwhere will the model which specifies each version be located?\r\nFurther, it would not be wise to make changes to the EVM until this is sorted out. So to be clear, I don't think we should put a date on this HF until the above is sorted out.",
