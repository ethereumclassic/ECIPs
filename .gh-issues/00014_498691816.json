    "body": "# ECIP types\r\nThere are three kinds of ECIP:\r\n\r\nA **Standards Track ECIP** describes any change that affects most or all Ethereum Classic implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Ethereum Classic. Standards Track ECIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation.\r\n\r\nAn **Informational ECIP** describes a Ethereum Classic design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Ethereum Classic community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational ECIPs do not necessarily represent a Ethereum Classic community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational ECIPs or follow their advice.\r\n\r\nA **Process ECIP** describes a process surrounding Ethereum Classic, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process ECIPs are like Standards Track ECIPs but apply to areas other than the Ethereum Classic protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Ethereum Classic's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational ECIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Ethereum Classic development. Any meta-ECIP is also considered a Process ECIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
