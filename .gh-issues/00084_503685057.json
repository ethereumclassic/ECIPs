    "body": "__Rel B. Cross client integration tests__\r\n\r\nAt ETC Labs, we've been developing an \"extrapolated\" test suite based on ethereum/tests that extends relevance for some of these \"sub-suites\" thru the anticipated Atlantis configuration. So far -- albeit experimentally -- classic geth and multigeth have shown consistent behavior for custom Difficulty and GeneralStateTests and we're working on adoption for Parity as well. \r\n\r\nWork on this at multi-geth can be found here: https://github.com/etclabscore/multi-geth/tree/feat/parity-chainspec-tests-fill-atlantis-2, and an example Atlantis-filled difficulty test can be found here: https://gist.github.com/whilei/cf5700910b41207a37d9f7ca58d0fd3d \r\n",
