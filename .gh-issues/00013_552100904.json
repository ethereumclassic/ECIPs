    "body": "Here's my current view on this proposal. This won't solve 51% attacks because they can't really be solved. I do agree that having a simpler/minimalistic and more standard implementation of hashing algorithm decreases the chances of a bug being found (yes, ethash working for the last 5 years tells nothing, we've seen critical vulnerabilities discovered in OpenSSL after more than 10 years). On the other hand, we have no guarantee ETC will end up as the network with the most sha3 hash rate. Even if we did in the beginning, it doesn't mean we can sustain the first place. If we fail to do that, it's no different than ethash from this perspective.\r\nThe second advantage that sha3 has over ethash is faster verification which enables things like FlyClient implementation (light clients for mobile that can verify the chain is connected without downloading all the block headers). I was talking to @Wolf-Linzhi about this and maybe there could be ways to make verification easier by modifying the epoch lengths or whatever to make the verification faster. At the time we did not know and I still don't, just saying that maybe there are modifications that make verification faster on ethash.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I want to mention is that making an instant switch actually opens up an attack vector. Nobody knows what hash rate to expect at the block that switches to sha3. This means that exchanges should not set the confirmation times to 5000 but closer to 50000. This makes ETC unusable and we should avoid such cases if possible. In case the community agrees to switch to sha3, we should consider having a gradual move to sha3 where we set difficulties accordingly so that 10% of blocks are mined with sha3 proof and 90% with ethash. Over time the percentage goes in favor of sha3 for example after half a year it is as 20% for sha3 etc. This makes the hash rate much more predictable compared to the instant switch and the exchanges would not need to increase the confirmation times to protect themselves because of the unknown hash rate. I don't know whether this is easy to implement, I imagine we could have 2 difficulties (each hashing algorithm having its own) but I'm not that familiar with the actual implementation and possible bad things this could bring.",
