So in the rare case that we cannot attain a license, it would be wise to consider the content before outright rejecting it. \r\n\r\nFor example, @pyskell had a proposal to [reduce the gas limit to 1,000,000](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/14). It doesn't require code changes and I don't see how copyright would even be relevant. That's all.",
