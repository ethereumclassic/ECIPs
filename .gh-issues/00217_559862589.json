    "body": "I think there is a decent opportunity here to get TurboGeth as a replacement Geth-family codebase for ETC by March.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/issues/162 (by @antsankov)\r\n\r\nA community member approached me looking for ways he could help ETC and I pointed him at that potential opportunity.   It would just involve side-porting of ETC support diffs from Multi-Geth into TurboGeth.\r\n\r\nFirst step would be just the ETC support.\r\nThen from there we could do the SHA3/Keccak256 support and Astor testnet support.\r\n\r\n@zmitton would you be happy to do SHA3/Keccak256 support against TurboGeth rather than Multi-Geth?
