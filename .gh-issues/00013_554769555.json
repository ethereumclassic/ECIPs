    "body": "@Wolf-Linzhi could you elaborate on\r\n\r\n> Keccak256 PoW ASIC is harder and more exclusive/expensive to make than Ethash ASIC.\r\n\r\nFind this claim hard to believe, considering that sha3 is part of ethash. Then again, not a hardware expert. Are you saying that linzhi and others now prefer to make asics for memory-bound algorithms instead of compute-bound, as fast memory is more accessible than access to 5nm TSMC fabs?",
