    "body": "with regard to eip161 @meowsbits there is a contract used by the EF to delete _some_ empties. I got it from Martin Swende. [here it is](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa43ebd8939d8328f5858119a3fb65f65c864c6dd#contracts), but it only cleans the ones from the attack, not all of them. My understanding is that the attacker must have generated addresses in a predictable mathematical way, and this contract just erases those ones using his same math. we can give this a try, hopefully it will remove the vast majority. It is also possible to remove all of them, but its a bit difficult to find them due to the \"secure tree\" abstraction - the fact that  a key use in the tree is the hash of the address. I can find the keys, but then I need thei preimages. I can probably get those another way but would have to comb through every transaction.\r\n\r\ntldr: the cleanup happens after the hard fork, so we should move forward, either way. plus i have the contract that can probably do a very good job",
