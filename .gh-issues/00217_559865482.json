    "body": "> I won't mind multi-geth being on Ethereum Classic Classic only at all\r\n\r\n@sorpaas I think the whole point of multi-geth is to be network-extensible, so it should - with adequate and relative developer support - provide configurable use for as many a wide set of EVM-based (and even beyond). _Multi_. I don't care which networks it ends up on; but it should strive to remove opinions for the sake of the code and the technology.\r\n\r\n@bobsummerwill \r\n\r\n> these IP issues\r\n\r\nI don't see IP issues, I see forks. Varying forks for varying use cases. Do you mean name-dilution (eg geth-x)?\r\n\r\n> no known provenance for contributions,\r\n\r\n[Git history](https://github.com/multi-geth/multi-geth/commits/master), or? \r\n\r\n> GPLv3 licensing which restricts who can use it\r\n\r\nCan you say more about your reasoning on this?",
