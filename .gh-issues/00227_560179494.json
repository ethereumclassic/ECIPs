This is not a given characteristic of _all_ attacks. This is unique (there many many known attacks with known solutions) and should be noted as being of particular interest for being theoretically unresolved. \r\n\r\nFor good form and good documentation, a general outline of what is at stake (scale, scope), status of resolution, and intended logistics to achieving acceptable resolutions (which Bob has started) would be useful.
