Signal yes, but not have this binding trigger.\r\n- Afri: proposes to just use the signal and not commit to the binding decision.\r\n- Zac: 5 years is too much\r\n- Afri: proposes 6 months - 1 million blocks\r\n- **rough consensus on the ECBP without binding decision trigger and longer signaling range (1m blocks?)\r\n\r\nECIP-1070: **ProgPOW**\r\n- Yaz: let's reject it\r\n- Greg: let's not jump conclusion\r\n- Greg: upstream clients have it, so we should consider it at least\r\n- Alex: ProgPOW has to be continously tweaked, enormouse security hole\r\n- Greg: but what about Asic resistance?\r\n- Alex: but the quality of the SHA-3 hashing algorithm, disagree with Asic resistance\r\n- Yaz: ProgPOW Asic is easily possible\r\n- Zac: ProgPOW is cool but not for blockchain, we dont want to tweak this over and over again\r\n- Afri: does anyone really want ProgPOW? does anyone disagree with rejecting it?\r\n- Greg disagrees\r\n- Alex: someone has to champion it then\r\n- Yaz: we should send a clear signal to ETH and reject it\r\n- Wei: But we should have an open process to allow it in future\r\n- **rough consensus to reject it but open to put it back in draft if someone champions it**\r\n\r\nECIP-1049: **Keccak-256**\r\n- Alex: introduction and motivation on SHA-3\r\n- Wei: has reservations, SHA-3 needs some work done\r\n- Wei: good way of liberation, high performant\r\n- Alex: we want Asics on the network\r\n- Wei: we should have Asics first\r\n- Tomek: without Asics we don't know efficiency, security concerns\r\n- Zac: we won't get Asics unless we change the algorithm\r\n- Mike: GPU and FPGA performance for SHA3 is very good and energy efficient\r\n- Terry: technical benefits are not clear enough to do such a drastic change \r\n- Alex: What's not clear, security or benefits?\r\n- Stev: we need more research and data, how can we be sure not being 51% attacked\r\n- Yaz: consider security of Nakamoto consensus\r\n- Yaz: Ethash was just designed for Ethereum to sustain ETH till PoS\r\n- Afri: states his opinion\r\n- **no conclusion yet**\r\n- _next call to be announced_ for the remaining decisions (probably Jan/2020)",
