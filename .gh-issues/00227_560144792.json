    "body": "As said on Twitter, my recommendation would be to call off and skip Aztlan until all issues have been fixed, because based on my last-minute review, ECIP-1061 is certainly rushed, and we'd be better fixing those issues first and/or apply account versioning. I currently cannot think of a way to fix this without account versioning.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the consensus is to move forward with Aztlan, I do not object ECIP-1061 and am certainly fine to just go ahead with the hard fork, because in theory, you can always fix any issues of hard forks with just more hard forks.",
