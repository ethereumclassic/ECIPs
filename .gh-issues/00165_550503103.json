    "body": "@BelfordZ One point you made above which I didn't reply to was \"Apache 2.0+\"\r\nI agree that that is not a good pattern.\r\nYou are trusting future Apache license authors to do the right thing.\r\nIt is a bad pattern just as n.n.n^ is a dangerous pattern for NPM modules.\r\nBetter to lock in specific versions, and make updates a conscious effort.\r\nIf there is an Apache 3.0 in the future which is even better then it should be a deliberate coordinated process to choose to update.\r\n\r\nExactly the same pattern as SHA256 -> SHA3 which you raised at ETC Summit, @antsankov, right?\r\n\r\nYou make a long-term decision, that gives all ecosystem participants certainty for a long time (maybe decades), and then if the facts-on-the-ground change (hash collisions, better license available, whatever) then you have to make a coordinated move to \"upgrade\", but that always needs to be a conscious and intentional choice.\r\n\r\nSame for the monetary policy.\r\n\r\nAnd I am starting to think that gaslimit is yet another example of that pattern, where we would also benefit from long-term certainty.\r\n\r\nThat was also my thinking behind this (if there is consensus on this and it is not seen as something which violates ETC philosophy).  I think that could just end up as a one-liner in ECIP-1000, or as a standalone ECIP in some other form.   Analogous to monetary policy, but providing a commitment on remaining with POW.  Maybe tied in with whatever ECIP we do on gaslimit, if we do one?\r\n\r\nhttps://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2019-10-06-pow-mining-explicit-social-contract/",
