In fact, SHA256 already has optimized instructions on [ARM](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0514g/way1395175472464.html) and [Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-sha-extensions). Chances of Ethash instructions in ARM and Intel are slim to none at this point.",
