ETC is NOT Linux or Apache or any old OSS system. ETC is a system that needs to have the highest standards of trust minimization\r\n2. Openness is necessary. It goes without saying that the rules of the game should be open for anyone to see and understand. Anyone should be able to participate in any layer of the system without asking for any permission whatsoever.\r\n3. IF ITS NOT BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT.",
