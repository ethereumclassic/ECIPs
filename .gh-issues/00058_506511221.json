    "body": "@TokenHash I think we'd better look for developers to be on the editors list. I agree @phyro and @kimisan have contributed a lot, but they may not be able to help a lot in the case of technically reviewing ECIPs.\r\n\r\nMy only objections for adding @BelfordZ and @shanejonas is that we may then have too many representatives from ETCLabs (we already have two -- @isaac and @soc1c). But that's just my opinion and it's up to everyone.",
