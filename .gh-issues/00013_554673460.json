Plus we learn from mistakes right ?\r\n\r\nAnyway [apparently i am not helping,](https://twitter.com/Yazanator/status/1195591840390627333) i thought it was a free and open instructive discussion. But look like my suggestions are not welcomed by some people and i have been [blocked ](https://twitter.com/Yazanator/status/1195591840390627333) from a twitter account to avoid posting.\r\n\r\nSo i will step out and let the \"right people\" discuss about it.\r\n\r\nAll the best for ETC.",
