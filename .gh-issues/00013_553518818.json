    "body": "Just want to point out that **the longer we debate** the move to thermodynamically efficient and cryptographically secure SHA3, **the less ETC's chances** to get the first mover advantage and be the dominant hashpower consumer chain.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.saturn.network/blog/discussing-sha3-for-ethereum-classic/\r\n\r\nThe best path towards migration is to move once a critical mass of hashrate (potentially with first generation of SHA3 ASICs operating) is available. This can either be bootstrapped via an incentivized testnet (e.g. monitor hashrate and issue bounty for Astor.host miners upon transition), or follow @phyro's gradual EthHash sunset schedule, with both algos running in parallel and slowly shifting block proportions (and thus rewards) from EthHash to SHA3 miners.\r\n\r\nLet's just make sure we avoid [Verge-like fuckups](https://www.ccn.com/privacy-coin-verge-succumbs-to-51-attack-again/).\r\n\r\nHappy chatting!",
