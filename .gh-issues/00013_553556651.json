    "body": "Yes, the dual hashing would need to be well thought out, I have not invested time to actually think of the consequences and the actual implementation.\r\n\r\nI'm still not convinced that being the first one matters. If we are the first one sure we are leading at the beginning, but as soon as another chain with SHA3 appears, the miners will mine whatever is the most profitable. And I guarantee you that there won't be a single SHA3 chain out there. The fewer chains that share the same algorithm, the less likely a more profitable one exists. If we judge by that, perhaps we should choose something that is proven secure for some time but also less known.",
