    "body": "I voted thumbup because I hope dexaran's proposal could be discussed without prejudice.\r\nI'm following recent discussions on Discord about the possibility ETC will become a security layer for ETH and other cryptos. I understand that the risk of a reward system for holders can can reduce the security as consequence of a decreased reward for miners.\r\nOn the other hand if ETC will be a L1 for other PoS cryptos it will become a kind of commodity and I don't see the advantage for holders.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm a long-term holder",
