    "body": "My meeting notes for the last section of the call:\r\n\r\n* Wei: Just to make it clear, does this mean we move forward with 1072 to \"Last Call\" status? If that is the case, how long should be the last call period? Three weeks?\r\n* Afri: Three weeks should be sufficient. We also get to evaluate it on the Ethereum network first.\r\n* [No further comments, assumed everyone agreed.]\r\n* Bob: Since we decide to move forward with 1072, does this mean we will change the hard fork name to Yingchun?\r\n* Wei: No. I'll modify the title of 1072 to make Yingchun the edition name, but since Aztlan was already decided, let's still call it the hard fork name.\r\n* Yaz: [Repeat what Wei has said] The hard fork name is already decided to be Aztlan, so that's what it should be called. I do not object giving it a small \"hat\" name Yingchun.\r\n* Afri: Okay, then let's call it Aztlan with Yingchun edition.\r\n\r\nI do not think Afri's meeting notes on this part is correct.\r\n\r\n* It logically does not follow if we are talking about 1072 for the whole section, and then suddenly jumped back to 1061 just for the last sentence.\r\n* It contradicts to Bob's question -- if we were indeed talking about 1061, Bob wouldn't have asked the question whether the hard fork will be named \"Yingchun\", because when the meeting happened, 1061 does not have that name at all.",
