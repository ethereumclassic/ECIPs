    "body": "I am against ECIP-1049 (sha3/keccak256) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- It devalues our upcoming Ethash ASIC.\r\n\r\n- PoW sets a price for newly issued coins. Changing PoW is price manipulation.\r\n\r\n- Trying to find a \"better\" PoW algo in a live blockchain is pretense of knowledge.\r\nModifying Hayek: \"Overconfidence in the use of science to control a blockchain will lead to the destruction of a blockchain which no brain has designed, but which has instead grown from the free efforts of thousands of individuals.\"\r\n\r\n- ECIP 1049, unless agreed to by 100% of the discussion participants, would go against the Crypto-Decentralist Manifesto https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2016-07-11-manifesto/\r\n\"The rules governing the blockchain network are known in advance. They’re exactly the same for everyone and not subject to change other than with 100% consensus. Yes, it must be 100%. Because any change to the system’s rules that not all participants freely agree to creates a network split, diminishing network value for everyone.\"\r\n\r\n- If you want to protect user funds, you also want to protect miner capital and PoW integrity, unless those miners turn against users or other miners.\r\n- PoW change introduces a discontinuity in security.\r\n- PoW change devalues current Ethash security investment of at least 20 mio USD.\r\n- PoW change impairs trust minimization and objectivity.\r\n- PoW change turns a blockchain into a distributed ledger.\r\n- PoW change sends the message that ETC has a security problem.\r\n\r\n- Minority argument doesn't hold (why should majority miners reject additional revenue?).\r\n- First to market argument doesn't hold (is ETC an experimental sandbox? size of security budget drives PoW investments).\r\n- Fundamental principle follow-the-longest-chain is thrown overboard for no good reason other than subjective judgment over which algo is \"better\".\r\n\r\n- Ethash will always be part of Ethereum, if you verify from genesis. If you want a new blockchain, why destroy an old one first?\r\n- Adopting ECIP 1049 will lead to months of discussions - when and how to switch over (gradually? dual Ethash/Keccak256 algo?), if or how to fund \"open\" asics (even though it will be harder to be more \"open\" than Linzhi's Ethash ASIC).\r\n\r\n- Keccak256 PoW ASIC is harder and more exclusive/expensive to make than Ethash ASIC.\r\n- Keccak256 PoW in 2020 is boring, not usable in other industry applications, forces backend innovation only.\r\n- Consider re-verifying the entire state from genesis using Keccak256, at least you then only have one verification algo.\r\n- If cannot decide between multiple subjectively \"best\" PoW algos, consider A) rolling a dice or B) multi-algo mining.",
