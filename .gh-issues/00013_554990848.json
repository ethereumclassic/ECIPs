    "body": "I would love to see ETC FlyClient. And I'm not a big fan of ethash. I like keccak256.\r\n\r\nBut in my opinion:\r\n - the change is not necessary (as ethash is not broken)\r\n - there are to many variables; we can only guess:\r\n   - hashrate after a change\r\n   - hashpower centralization/decentralization\r\n   - involvement of the miners\r\n   - algo switches of other chains\r\n   - mining profitability\r\n   - ASICs availability \r\n\r\nI really don't get the point in being the first to adopt, or being one of the biggest chains possibly switching to keccak256. It doesn't mean that ETC will be \"dominant\" chain for this algo mining (except it's the only keccak chain) - most profitable chain will most probably be dominant. This can also be affected by some sentiment (for some ETC is a scam, or it's just an unnecessary fork).\r\nAnd even dominant chain is not 100% safe. It's just more expensive to attack / more secure.  \r\n\r\nI really don't like the argument about 51% attacks. It's the feature of the PoW. It's not human decision which chain is valid - if reorg happens, it just happens - it's the law of PoW. Trying to \"manually\" decide which chain is \"the right one\" is IMHO against ETC principles.\r\nThe only \"51% attack\" that is really dangerous is a prolonged DoS (continuous reorg / censorship) intended to kill ETC (unusable chain for days/weeks -> price drop -> mining not profitable). Other cases are just a matter of confirmation time. ",
