    "body": "Also, whether or not we follow this plan, please let's change the name from Agharta.  I can never spell it correctly.  We need a simpler and more memorable name.\r\n\r\nI am advocating for \"Phoenix\" for obvious reasons.  This will be the HF (whether in a single HF or two-phase) which sees ETC reborn, to advance PAST the ETH protocol.  I cannot think of anything more appropriate to name the HF.\r\n\r\nAnd very simple to remember.  Great for marketing of this HF too.\r\n",
