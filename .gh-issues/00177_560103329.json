If someone can bypass the process today, they may bypass it tomorrow to move forward a DAO-like hard fork on Ethereum Classic. This is the only process we have at this moment. As the author of the currently accepted ECIP process, it's important for me, and for community members, to make sure it is functional.\r\n\r\nI find the rest of your post was just... name calling and personal attacks? Anyway, I'll just pretend I didn't see them! :)",
