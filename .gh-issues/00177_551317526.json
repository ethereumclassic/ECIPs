    "body": "Please can I suggest that we move the timelines up on the Aztlán Upgrade meeting, @soc1c?\r\n\r\nCore Devs Call: Mining Algorithm Upgrade\r\nNov 21st is fine, I think.  Two weeks time.\r\n\r\nCore Devs Call: ECIP-1061 Aztlán Upgrade\r\nI suggest that we move this to Nov 28th, because we can be starting to talk about this before Agharta is finalized.  Versus Dec 19th as currently planned.   The main critical path here will NOT be technical, but gathering social consensus, so having this 3 weeks earlier would be very helpful.   Also, by Dec 19th a number of people will be having Christmas plans.\r\n\r\nCore Devs Call: ECIP-1056 Agharta Finalization\r\nDec 5th\r\n",
