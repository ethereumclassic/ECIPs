Is this near what you're referring to?\r\n\r\n> Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer likened Linux to a kind of cancer on intellectual property. Microsoft sued Lindows, a Linux operating system that could run Microsoft Windows applications, as a trademark violation. The court rejected the claim and after Microsoft purchased its trademark, the software changed its name to Linspire.\r\n> [...]\r\n> In the 2010s and under new CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft began to adopt open source into its core business. In contrast to Ballmer's stance, Nadella presented a slide that read, \"Microsoft loves Linux\".\r\n> [...]\r\n>  In 2016, Microsoft introduced Windows Subsystem for Linux, which lets Linux applications run on the Windows operating system. The company invested in Linux server technology and Linux development to promote cross-platform compatibility and collaboration with open source companies and communities, culminating with Microsoft's platinum sponsorship of the Linux Foundation and seat on its Board of Directors.\r\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_and_open_source\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> \"zero defense\" is true. What is your objection to that?\r\n\r\nI, of course, have no objection to raising awareness, if not alarms, if this is a serious threat. But so far I don't see any __concrete legal precedent or clause__ that would suggest what it seems you understand as a certain and deterministic outcome. ",
