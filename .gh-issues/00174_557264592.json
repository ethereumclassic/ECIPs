    "body": "@zmitton I wasn't available for the call in the first 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nLet's put aside the issue that the decision was most likely interpreted and framed incorrectly by Afri. Consider, would you be *really sure* that you want to put forward a decision just because someone who has objections wasn't on the call?\r\n\r\nIn an imaginary scenario, Afri or other meeting moderators can arrange a meeting to move ProgPoW forward, and put the date/time of the meeting specifically that none of the ProgPoW opponents could attend. Then the decision of adopting ProgPoW can be easily reached. Would you move forward with ProgPoW just because of that? No. The same applies to 1076.",
