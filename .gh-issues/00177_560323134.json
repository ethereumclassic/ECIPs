    "body": "@YazzyYaz I think @drd34d is rather making his own conclusions as an outsider, after reading all the arguments above about what has happened. So far, I've only seen logical inconsistency from the side still arguing \"1061 after being edited\". If you want to find attestations from people who attended the call to confirm that the call consensus was indeed 1072, look for Discord chat history.\r\n\r\nAs the content of the call was indeed about 1061/1702, let me modify the issue title to reflect that.",
