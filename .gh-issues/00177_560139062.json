    "body": "@bobsummerwill We not only agreed on the scope, but also, we agreed on the ECIP to move forward in the meeting. This can be proved in the meeting notes that I explicitly asked whether the the specification we will move forward is ECIP-1072:\r\n\r\n> Wei: Just to make it clear, does this mean we move forward with 1072 to \"Last Call\" status? If that is the case, how long should be the last call period? Three weeks?\r\n\r\nNow. I do not know why you want to bring up all those controversy again. You can read Discord chat history to know that the above is a fact independently acknowledged by multiple community members.\r\n\r\nAnd again, allow me to ignore the personal attack points you made in your comments. That's just pointless to reply.",
