    "body": "I am supportive of this ECIP.\r\nWe need to get the gas limit under control PRIOR to potential mass migration from ETH or ETC when we catch up on protocol.\r\n1MB might be too low.\r\n\r\nI think we also need to look at adding UASF/UAHF as the means of implementing this limit, rather than just having this as something \"informational\".   So really looking at BTC-style limiting, to avoid compromising decentralization and avoiding pushing scaling beyond what our POW L1 can currently cope with.\r\n",
