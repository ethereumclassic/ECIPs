    "body": "> ### Is keccak256 suitable?\r\n> Yes. It is well-known and widely implemented. No major chain uses it. ETC will be the most valuable keccak256 chain. Semi-optimized GPU implementations exist. It is available on most chains we will want to interoperate with. It is extremely unlikely to be broken or backdoored.\r\n> ### Summary\r\n> Change algorithms. Keccak256 is one of the better choices available.\r\n\r\nTotally agree with that proposal.\r\n\r\nAnother one would be about implementing a solution of multiple algorithms with a limitation of each to a certain percentage like 20% whereas the 51% attack would be nearly impossible to realize like digibyte implemented on their network ?\r\n\r\nhttps://digibyte.io/about-digibyte-blockchain\r\n\r\nThey even put recently in place a new algo adocrypt (based on SHA3) that change itself every 10days. How about that...\r\n\r\nThe wiser way would be to go not only with Keccak256, but to have multi-mining algorithms in a more decentralized & secured way\r\n",
