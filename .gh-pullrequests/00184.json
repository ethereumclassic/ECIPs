    "body": "This adds three new hard fork meta, with different options to apply the Istanbul upgrade in a backward compatible way:\r\n\r\n* ECIP-1072: Apply Istanbul directly, but remove the offending EIP-1884.\r\n* ECIP-1073: Apply Istanbul with account versioning ECIP-1040 / EIP-1702. Currently both Parity and Geth have the implementation required. However, the drawback, as discussed last time, is that this will require a new account version for every hard fork.\r\n* ECIP-1074: Apply Istanbul with account versioning, and with forward-compatible EVM changes. Currently no client has implemented 39-UNGAS and 40-UNUSED yet, so this will require more work, and we will need to maintain our own ecosystem tools. However, it gives us a good future foundation for modifying EVMs further. This is basically combination of ECIP-1065 Kunming hard fork with Istanbul.",
