    "body": "ECBP-1076 is basically MINERVOTE. But TBH, if we're going to the route of letting miners decide PoW algorithm change, then I'd suggest we do something more sophisticated, such as 27-MINERVOTE, rather than ad hoc process that still involves human factors. https://specs.that.world/27-minervote/\r\n\r\nIf you are a miner, I would guess the most important thing you want to review are:\r\n\r\n* Voting range: in ECBP-1076 this is unspecified (?). In 27-MINERVOTE this is a known recurrence period, usually several weeks to a month.\r\n* Activation time: in ECBP-1076 this is 6 months (!). In 27-MINERVOTE this is again, usually several weeks to a month.\r\n* Threshold: in ECBP-1076 this is 70%, meaning there may be still 30% of the miners against a particular algorithm change. In 27-MINERVOTE we don't have a fixed number, but for things controversial like this we may want a higher threshold, such as 90%.",
