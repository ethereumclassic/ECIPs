You can:\r\n\r\n* Listen to the meeting recording yourself to confirm that in the end we decided to move forward 1072.\r\n* Read https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/199#pullrequestreview-323755348 and #176 to understand the objection, and why we decided to go with the \"option\" ECIP model due to Afri rushing to merge a change meant for the \"just-one Aztlan\". Check `#ecips` history to confirm that Afri agreed on this.\r\n* Read below to know that Afri has since refused to discuss and maliciously dismissed any objections. https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/199#event-2837816513",
