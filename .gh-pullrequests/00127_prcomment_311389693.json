As it stands, multiple entities can be contacting 3rd party organizations as “official” representatives, recommending different clients and actions, or even publishing conflicting information that can lead to centralization, network splitting, and other systemic issues caused by this lack of coordination. \n+\n+There can also be new processes that come out as a result of this, ie a “safe list” of 3rd party organizations. It is not the purpose of this ECIP to outline these.\n+\n+\n+## Specification\n+\n+This process is comprised of 3 parts\n+\n+1) Representative Selection\n+2) Message Construction\n+3) Channels\n+\n+### Representative Selection\n+\n+Each Client (geth/multigeth/parity/mantis) should have 1 representative selected to help in the outreach process.  In addition, there should be 2 representatives voted by the Client representatives that are unaffiliated with any of the Organizations.\n+\n+This selection happens at the “Final Call” of the event.",
