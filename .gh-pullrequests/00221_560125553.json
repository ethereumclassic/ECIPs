    "body": "This is a very simple \"tweak\" to ECIP-1000 which I don't object to very much.\r\n\r\nI agree that in retrospect it would have been better for the variants of Aztlan to be captured as PRs against 1061.   Having extra ECIPs for the other \"Editions\" would have been fine too, as long as they were just Withdrawn after we had the meeting, because they were then obsolete.\r\n\r\nI would even have been fine for us to \"switch horse\" from 1061 to 1072 as that point, in recognition of \"Wei's plan\" having \"won\", but honestly had no preference at all.    Updating 1061 at the stage, plus adding Wei as an author was marginally better.   Keep the same EIP (same URL), etc.   All cool.\r\n\r\nAnd then @sorpaas went bonkers.\r\n\r\nWe should not NEED the language you suggest here, but I don't object to it.   Probably best to force all the discussion around a pending HF into a single issue, yes, to force that resolution and avoid this kind of \"rival HF definitions\" situation again.",
