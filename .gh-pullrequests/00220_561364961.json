    "body": "> I can only conclude, for now, that there's something unjustified in ECIP-1061 that you want to hide.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly are you trying to say here?\r\n\r\nThe call was about 1061 NOT 1072. You creating 10721 instead of making a PR is a violation of ECIP-1000.\r\n\r\nDirectly from ECIP-100: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/blob/master/_specs/ecip-1000.md\r\n\r\n> a single ECIP contain a single key proposal or new idea\r\n\r\nI don't know how you can interpret that any other way. \r\n\r\nWe also have the last 2 hard forks where we've made PRs to those instead of creating separate identical ones.\r\n\r\nI dont see any precedent for making `n` many ECIPs for a single key proposal, and ECIP-1000 says NOT to do it.",
