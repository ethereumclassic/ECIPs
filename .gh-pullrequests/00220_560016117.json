    "body": "@shanejonas As said above, having multiple specifications about the same \"key proposal\" is not a violation of the ECIP process. The primary example is account versioning. There are also many other examples such as miner signaling proposals. We don't have a special category currently for \"hard fork ECIPs\", so this currently applies to it.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I said above, I'm happy to explore ways with you, to restrict future \"hard fork ECIPs\" to \"single one only\". I don't have any problem with that.",
