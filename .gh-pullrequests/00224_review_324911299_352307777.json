Bits\n+discussions-to: TBD\n+status: WIP\n+type: Meta\n+created: 2019-11-29T14:17:42-05:00\n+resolution: TBD\n+---\n+\n+### Abstract\n+\n+Establishing _Fork_ type ECIPs, and their standards and processes.\n+\n+#### TL;DR\n+\n+Make ECIPs with `Type` _Fork_ a thing. _Fork_ ECIPs should follow this process:\n+- A \"shell\" Fork ECIP is opened, fitting the [template provided](TODO). This ECIP __does not initially include `Activation Block Number` or `Features` specifications__.\n+- While in `WIP` or `Draft` status, one or more change sets are proposed against this document (eg. via Github Pull Requests) __modifying BOTH `Activation Block Number` and `Features` specifications__.\n+- ... Stuff happens; there are comments, emails, meetings, bribes, blogs, bragging, trolling, haranguing, arguing, debating, pondering, editing, compromising, constructive criticiziing, etc...\n+- One change set is merged to modify the Fork ECIP, yielding a COMPLETE and UNIQUE hard fork specification document.\n+\n+### Definition\n+\n+Fork ECIPs are defined as ECIPs specifying PROTOCOL ACTIVATION of any one or more Standards-Core track ECIP(s) at a specified activation block number.\n+\n+#### Standards\n+\n+Fork ECIPs should contain only placeholder information for ECIP-sets and block activation numbers while in `WIP` or `Draft` status. \n+\n+Modification to any of `Last Call`, `Accepted`, `Final`, or `Active` statuses should be accompanied by the introduction (merge) of a single change set containing COMPLETE and UNIQUE definitions of the placeholder values.",
