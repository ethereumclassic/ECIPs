    "body": "@husainfazel You also cannot claim that you have consensus on ECIP-1061 when more than 1 person attended meeting claiming otherwise. That is the solid foundation for why the action moving ECIP-1061 to \"Last Call\" is invalid and violated the ECIP process. And that's the solid foundation for why we need irregular process transitions.\r\n\r\nThe logic inconsistency I made was not based on my note, it was based on Afri's note, which was published right away after the meeting ends. No one has able to dispute those logic inconsistencies, and that makes it a strong evidence that the decision reached was ECIP-1072.",
