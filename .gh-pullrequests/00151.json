Full details are available in [#1785](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1785). Note that these patches are not yet (as of 2018-10-04) in an upstream release of libxml2.\n> \n> \n> ### Bug fixes\n> \n> * [MRI] Fix regression in installation when building against system libraries, where some systems would not be able to find libxml2 or libxslt when present. (Regression introduced in v1.8.3.) [#1722](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1722)\n> * [JRuby] Fix node reparenting when the destination doc is empty. [#1773](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1773)\n> \n> \n> ## 1.8.4 / 2018-07-03\n> \n> ### Bug fixes\n> \n> * [MRI] Fix memory leak when creating nodes with namespaces. (Introduced in v1.5.7) [#1771](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1771)\n> \n> \n> ## 1.8.3 / 2018-06-16\n> \n> ### Security Notes\n> \n> [MRI] Behavior in libxml2 has been reverted which caused CVE-2018-8048 (loofah gem), CVE-2018-3740 (sanitize gem), and CVE-2018-3741 (rails-html-sanitizer gem). The commit in question is here:\n> \n> > https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2/commit/960f0e2\n> \n> and more information is available about this commit and its impact here:\n> \n> > [flavorjones/loofah#144](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/144)\n> \n> This release simply reverts the libxml2 commit in question to protect users of Nokogiri's vendored libraries from similar vulnerabilities.\n> \n> If you're offended by what happened here, I'd kindly ask that you comment on the upstream bug report here:\n> \n> > https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769760\n> \n> \n> ### Dependencies\n> \n> * [MRI] libxml2 is updated from 2.9.7 to 2.9.8\n> \n> \n> ### Features\n> \n> * Node#classes, #add_class, #append_class, and #remove_class are added.\n> * NodeSet#append_class is added.\n> * NodeSet#remove_attribute is a new alias for NodeSet#remove_attr.\n> * NodeSet#each now returns an Enumerator when no block is passed (Thanks, [@&#8203;park53kr](https://github.com/park53kr)!)\n></tr></table> ...
