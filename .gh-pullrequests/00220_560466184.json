This PR's option allows us to move forward with ECIP-1061, while also maintain the integrity of ECIP process. Without it, people could use the argument that 1061 does not follow the process to create contentious hard fork, which is bad for Ethereum Classic.\r\n\r\nI agree that this is human process. Not everything is black and white, but some actions, like what is being documented in this PR, clearly is.",
