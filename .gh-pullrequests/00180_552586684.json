    "body": "@TokenHash I disagree with your interpretation that \"coordinator\" is somehow on a lower level than \"editor\" and considered to be \"assistant\". If we consider ECIP to be a team, then editors are software engineers, and coordinators are project managers. Coordinators play an important role in coordinating the ECIP process, especially during hard fork.\r\n\r\nI think it's a mistake that you removed yourself from the proposed list. You should add yourself back in.",
