    "body": "Of 41 ECIPs (draft + last call + final + active):\r\n\r\n• 9 use copyright/license CC0\r\n• 2 use copyright/license Apache 2.0\r\n• 30 have no license\r\n\r\nOf the 9 that used CC0, they are 7 different authors who used it. One author used Apache 2.0 for 2 ECIPs.\r\n\r\nI suspect the 30 which have no license it's because ETC was very disorganized before and the ECIP-X which is generally used as a template did not have a #Copyright/Licensing section by default so all authors omitted that detail.\r\n\r\nI still don't see any rationale to establish a root license instead of the options given in ECIP-1000.\r\n\r\nIt is, from now on, according to ECIP-1000, a function of editors to actually supervise that authors include a copyright/license from the options.\r\n\r\nI do agree to seek all past authors to add a license to their past ECIPs, I can do that.
