    "body": "> Does it matter if a good PR / ECIP comes with a PR message that is vulgar? \r\n\r\nNo, it shouldn't matter and we should allow for dissent. We can rectify some of the language to allow for vulgarism that isn't a personal attack on a person per se. What I hope to solve with this CoC is to minimize harassment and doxing of fellow ECIP participants when they feel uncomfortable contributing to the ECIP process.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to hear suggestions and if you'd like to add/modify some of the content. It's a draft after all and subject to change.",
