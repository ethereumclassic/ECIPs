    "body": "@shanejonas If your argument is that creating new ECIP is wrong, then I think you have seriously misunderstood ECIP-1000 and the spirit of ECIP process. Reading ECIP-1000 carefully, you can find this text: \r\n\r\n> We try to build consensus around an ECIP, but if thatâ€™s not possible, you can always submit a competing ECIP.\r\n\r\nYou haven't been able to provide a single argument for the logic inconsistency of the meeting notes provided by Afri, and you haven't been able to provide a single argument why dismissing another editor's reasonable objection is not a violation of the ECIP process, which makes ECIP-1061 invalid.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I don't see any clear argument from you why you're against those solid arguments and facts. I can only conclude, for now, that there's something unjustified in ECIP-1061 that you want to hide. Fortunately, all ECIP editing actions are public and editors are accountable for what they have done. Hence irregular process transition.",
