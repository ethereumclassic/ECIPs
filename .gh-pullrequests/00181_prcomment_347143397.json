Note that when an ECIP is already deployed, it is recommended to talk privately with the ECIP authors or ECIP editors first.\n+\n+Security alerts related to the website source code will be addressed by ECIP editors. Security concerns related to hosting and delivery of the ecips.ethereumclassic.org website will be addressed by either org admins or ECIP editors.
