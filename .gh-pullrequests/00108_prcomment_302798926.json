An editor will review your draft and ask if anyone objects to its finalization. If the editor decides there is no rough consensus - for instance, because contributors point out significant issues with the ECIP - they may close the PR and request that you fix the issues in the draft before trying again.\n \n # ECIP Status Terms\n-* **Draft** - An ECIP that is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.\n+* **Work in progress (WIP)** -- An ECIP where the author has asked the Ethereum Classic community whether an idea has any chance of support, he/she will write a draft ECIP as a pull request. However, if the idea is still in a very early stage, and will have a lot of commints and changes by the author, editors or contributors, it may be better to enter it as a WIP. Make sure to add [WIP] in the title (example: [WIP] ECIP-X) of the early stage ECIP so other members can mute it if they are not interested in participating at this stage. ",
