We should update the directions to warn anonymous authors that they may be severely delayed as there is extra leg work for the editors\r\n\r\nAn observation: Tracking down _all_ authors signatures is not strictly necessary for proposals that are just a parameter choice like for instance ecip-1047 (but we already have the author for that one).",
