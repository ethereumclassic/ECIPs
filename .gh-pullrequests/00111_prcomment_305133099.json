When linking to an image in the ECIP, use the related links such as `./assets/ecip-X/image.png`.\n \n-# ECIP types\n+## ECIP Types\n \n-There are three kinds of ECIP:\n+There are three types of ECIP:\n \n-- **A Standards Track ECIP** describes any change that affects most or all Ethereum Classic implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Ethereum Classic. Standards Track ECIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation.\n-- **An Informational ECIP** describes a Ethereum Classic design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Ethereum Classic community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational ECIPs do not necessarily represent a Ethereum Classic community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational ECIPs or follow their advice.\n-- **A Process ECIP** describes a process surrounding Ethereum Classic, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process ECIPs are like Standards Track ECIPs but apply to areas other than the Ethereum Classic protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Ethereum Classic's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational ECIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Ethereum Classic development. Any meta-ECIP is also considered a Process ECIP.\n+- A **Standard Track ECIP** describes any change that affects most or all Ethereum Classic implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Ethereum Classic. Furthermore, Standard Track ECIPs can be broken down into the following categories:\n+  - **Core** - improvements requiring a consensus fork, as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to core developer discussions.\n+  - **Networking** - improvements to networking protocol specifications.\n+  - **Interface** - improvements around client [API/RPC] specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names  and contract ABIs.\n+  - **ECBP (Ethereum Classic Best Practice)** - application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards, name registries, URI schemes, library/package formats, and wallet formats.\n+- A **Meta ECIP** describes a **process** surrounding Ethereum Classic or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process ECIPs are like Standard Track ECIPs, but apply to areas other than the Ethereum Classic protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Ethereum Classic's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational ECIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process (e.g. this ECIP-1000 process document), and changes to the tools or environment used in Ethereum Classic development. *Any meta-ECIP is also considered a Process ECIP.*",
