    "body": "If 1072 was agreed upon in the recent core development call then I believe that should be the one moved to \"accepted\" not 1061. ECIP-1061 should be moved to withdrawn per the ECIP process.  1072 is in fact the Yingchun Edition, which is what was agreed upon. Would love to hear other feedback on this move.",
