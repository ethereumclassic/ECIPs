    "body": "I read your comments. You do realize that several days later you are producing a set of note that corroborate your version of events, had you posted a full set of notes for the entire meeting right at the start, you'll find people less likely to dispute the veracity of those notes/your recollection of the meeting. @shanejonas has a different view and without a recording of the conversation, no-one can say who is correct.\r\n\r\nI won't post anymore because I'm an outsider to this process and I don't want to antagonize anyone but you CANNOT claim community consensus that your ECIP was the one everyone settled on when there's more than 1 person that attended the meeting claiming otherwise!",
