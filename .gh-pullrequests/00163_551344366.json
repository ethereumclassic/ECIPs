    "body": "Thank you @TokenHash for the well constructed criticism. \r\n\r\nHere are the main reasons for why I propose apache 2.0 for all, without exception:\r\n1. Avoid copyleftist licenses and all licenses which have political implications\r\n1. Avoid contagious licenses that may taint the validity of Apache 2.0. \r\n1. Avoid unknown issues that may arise in having a project that contains multiple licenses.\r\n1. Any works licensed under Apache 2.0 can be copied and relicensed without issue - If you want slightly change an ECIP and relicense it, patent it, what ever, go ahead. Apache 2 is freedom.\r\n\r\nThat said, this isnt a hill im willing to die on. Should this be a deal breaker for you folks, I'm happy to meet halfway, adding root license of apache 2.0, allowing other licenses to be specified, but I would urge that any GNU, GPL, or as I put, politically infused licenses not be included in the allowable list. But just typing those words makes me feel dirty, as I don't really want to be an accomplice in having more than 1 license to maybe one day have to deal with.",
