 Security concerns with each individual ECIP should be addressed to the ECIP authors, the specified `discussion-to` locations, or ECIP editors. Note that when an ECIP is already deployed, it is recommended to talk privately with the ECIP authors or ECIP editors first.
 
-Security alerts related to the website source code will be addressed by ECIP editors. Security concerns related to hosting and delivery of the ecips.ethereumclassic.org website will be addressed by either org admins or ECIP editors. They will not be made publicly until mitigating solutions are identified. Once a remedy is found, part of the repair process may be automated by [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/).

 This meta document is agnostic to any mining algorithm. Its sole purpose is specifying a process how to openly determine and select a mining algorithm for Ethereum Classic.
 
 ### Motivation
-The decision to change the Ethereum Classic mining algorithm - or to keep it as is - is not an easy one to make. It should be done by broad consensus with all stakeholders involved - miners, investors, application and core developers, and anyone else who feels having a stake in ETC. This meta document proposes a process of how to facilitate the potential change of the mining algorithm and parameters.

 No signaling favors the status quo (ECBP-1076-A) and effectively rejects ECIPs 1041, 1043, 1047, 1049, and 1070.
