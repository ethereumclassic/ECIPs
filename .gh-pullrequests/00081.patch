+### ECIP-1061: Atzlán EVM and Protocol Upgrades
+
+    ECIP: 1061
+    Title: Atzlán EVM and Protocol Upgrades
+    Status: Draft
+    Type: Standards Track
+    Author: Talha Cross (@soc1c)
+    Created: 2019-06-06
+
+### Simple Summary
+
+Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation _Istanbul_ network protocol upgrades on the Ethereum
+Classic network in a hard-fork code-named _Atzlán_ to enable maximum compatibility across these networks.
+
+### Abstract
+
+Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the
+_Istanbul_ hardforks. The proposed changes for Ethereum Classic's _Atzlán_ upgrade include:
+
+- TBD
+
+This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:
+
+- `TBD` on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet (TBD 2020)
+- `TBD` on Morden Classic PoW-testnet (TBD 2020)
+- `TBD` on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet (TBD 2020)
+
+For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the _Specification_
+section of this document.
+
+### Motivation
+
+To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes shall be added to the Ethereum Classic
+networks, all of which have been in use on the Ethereum Foundation networks since late 2019.
+
+### Specification
+
+Technical specifications for each EIP can be found at those documents respectively:
+
+- TBD
+
+### Rationale
+
+__Interoperability__: Establishing and maintaining interoperable behavior between Ethereum clients is essential for
+developers and end-user adoption, yielding benefits for all participating chains (e.g., ETH and ETC, Ropsten and Morden,
+Görli and Kotti).
+
+__Immutability__: None of the introduced new opcodes in the EVM has the potential to change the behavior of existing
+contracts; in the case where previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode would have been deployed to the network, none of
+them would be able to modify the state of the Ethereum Classic networks retrospectively. Adding opcodes to the EVM
+increases its functionality and should be considered a feature upgrade rather than a modification.
+
+### Implementation
+
+Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible.
+
+The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the _Istanbul_ features currently:
+
+- TBD
