    "body": "@meowsbits I'm happy to see that now you understands, and at least see lights in the intention of this PR.\r\n\r\n> The most important part for me is establishing in the documentation procedural specifications for handling proposed modifications to the suggested Irregular Process Transitions appendix section, since this section is... well, Irregular... and thus may call for additional or modified specifications different from the basic specs for general ECIP change sets.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I would expect the \"irregular process transition\" never grows again, and just stay as what it is now. If there are ever new additions to this section, that means someone violated the ECIP process again, which is rather an extreme and bad situation. That's also why I don't think we can establish procedures for new additions, and why I would rather keep it as one PR -- I really don't want to see a second item being added to the list.\r\n\r\nThis is also the reason why most Ethereum clients have a specific `theDAO` config, and do not currently have a generic config that allows other account recovery to be added.",
