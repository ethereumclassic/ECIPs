    "body": "I am copying my review from https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/220#discussion_r352615121 because I hope and expect the line it cites to be resolved, which would result in its \"collapse\" on Github UI; I want the review's content to be visible nonetheless. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMost importantly, @sorpaas, __you need to remove these and all mentions of personal names__ which may or may not actually be associated with, but are intended to be associated with, @soc1c, at his request (see link below). Having done so and continuing to do so represents not only poor taste, but also a very plausible case of slander, and cannot be tolerated in any context. \r\n\r\nIf we are to establish Irregular Process Transitions, I think we should make the following effort:\r\n- Step back and consider if we actually do, understanding that the core concept is paradoxical, ie. _Did not follow process but followed process._\r\n- Establish beyond reasonable doubt that an event (which must be clearly defined) indeed qualifies as such, with something like a \"rough consensus.\" Hum....?\r\n- Establish (somehow, miraculously) an as-near-to-objective-as-possible and as-near-to-comprehensive-as-possible account of the bespoke un-/impossible process.\r\n\r\nIn the case that these hypothetical procedures and qualifications (as I've roughly outlined) for an Appendix and its contents can be met, then we might have something worth permanently and canonically documenting.\r\n\r\nIn the case these are not or cannot be met, then we run a very great risk of seeing this potential content and it's like used unilaterally as an unconstructive tool to allege grudges under ambiguous and/or subjective circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, I see the proposed content sadly as the latter case, where __conditions and content are insufficient to qualify as an objective representation of affairs__ (which stands to reason, considering it's provenance from an alleged aggrieved party in the case cited).\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/220#issuecomment-560103503\r\n",
