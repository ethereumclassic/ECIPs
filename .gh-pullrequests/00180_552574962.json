    "body": "> What's the difference between Coordinator and Editor?\r\n\r\n@soc1c it just emerges from what has been happening in practice. A coordinator is like an assistant to editors and ecip authors, but with no technical skills, and no authorization to merge ecips or review software code. A coordinator has time to do housekeeping things.\r\n\r\nExamples where I have been assisting editors:\r\n\r\n1. I copied ECIP-1055 from ETC Labs Core to Ethereum Classic repo with the authorization of the author.\r\n2. I reviewed and approved the latest ECIPs by Sorpaas (1040, 1068, 1069, etc.) because they were just copies of corresponding EIPs)\r\n3. I reviewed and adapted texts of ECIP-1000\r\n4. I moved ecip-1016 to \"withdrawn\" and added the original author with the author consent\r\n5. many more actions\r\n\r\nthe reason for creating the formal \"coordinator\" position is that I thought to make it formal makes it more transparent as many actions are made by non-editors and that seems irregular in the system unless the \"coordinator\" role is added",
