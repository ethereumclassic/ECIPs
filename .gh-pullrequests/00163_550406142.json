A bunch of \"contributors\" to this repository were for EIP files in the original cloning and those files are since deleted.   Or contributions were typo fixes or readme changes or merging.  Small things which would need meet the requirement of \"IP\".   We can ignore those.\r\n\r\nSee https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14OlEk2MhsEr9vn5dqgVIw1h8mWqKymon3lbnwp1QwUY/edit#gid=871150240\r\nwhere those are represented by crossed out green cells.",
