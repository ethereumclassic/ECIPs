Its sole purpose is specifying a process how to openly determine and select a mining algorithm for Ethereum Classic.\n+This meta document is agnostic to any mining algorithm. Its sole purpose is specifying a process for miners to signal their preferred mining algorithm for Ethereum Classic.\n \n ### Motivation\n-The decision to change the Ethereum Classic mining algorithm - or to keep it as is - is not an easy one to make. It should be done by broad consensus with all stakeholders involved - miners, investors, application and core developers, and anyone else who feels they have a stake in ETC. This meta document proposes a process of how to facilitate the potential change of the mining algorithm and parameters.\n+The decision to change the Ethereum Classic mining algorithm - or to keep it as is - is not an easy one to make. It should be done by broad consensus with all stakeholders involved - miners, investors, application and core developers, and anyone else who feels they have a stake in ETC. This meta document proposes a process of how miners could signal in favor of one potential change of the mining algorithm and parameters.\n \n ### Available Options\n Currently, the following options are debatable.\n \n - **ECBP-1076-A**: _\"Ethash Status Quo.\"_ The mining algorithm will be untouched as it is since genesis, as **Ethash** function with a statically **increasing DAG**.\n - **ECBP-1076-B**: _\"Ethash Limited DAG.\"_ The mining algorithm will be untouched as it is since genesis, as **Ethash** function. However, the **DAG size will be limited** as specified in [ECIP-1043](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1043).\n - **ECBP-1076-C**: _\"Keccak256 (SHA3).\"_ The mining algorithm will be **changed to Keccak256** as specified in [ECIP-1049](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1049).\n-- **ECBP-1076-D**: _\"ProgPoW.\"_ The mining algorithm will be **changed to ProgPow** as specified in [ECIP-1070](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1070).\n+- ~~**ECBP-1076-D**: _\"ProgPoW.\"_ The mining algorithm will be **changed to ProgPow** as specified in [ECIP-1070](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1070).~~ \n \n-Eventually, the community has to decide on one.\n+    _Note: ProgPoW was rejected by the community on Nov/20, 2019. However, miners can still signal for this option if they prefer this over the other options._\n \n-### Process\n-The following process facilitates all stakeholders in various stages.",
