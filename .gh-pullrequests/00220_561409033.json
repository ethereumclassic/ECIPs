    "body": "> That's just double standard, or is this a personal attack against me that violates the Code of Conduct?\r\n\r\nHow is it a personal attack? Afri published the entire meeting notes right after the call. It wasn't disputed till he made a PR for ECIP-1061 Last Call.\r\n\r\n> Please stop this. This is clearly personal attack and violation of Code of Conduct, which should get you issued an warning.\r\n\r\nHow is defining your actions of slandering Afri as a vendetta considered a personal attack? I don't think I follow your logic. If it's not something personal against Afri, then I apologize and look forward to you removing his name from the PR as you claim it's not a vendetta.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Code of Conduct is still in Draft stage, which I hope you can recall means its subject to change as defined in the ECIP-1000 document. If it's in Active stage, that's different.",
