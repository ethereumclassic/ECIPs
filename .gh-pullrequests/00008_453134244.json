    "body": "@xaoyaolee - agreed, I have researched and currently do not see any Keccak256 ASICs.\r\n\r\n@saturn-network - I agree with that approach, we should begin creating a Keccak256 testnet for interested users and miners to start testing on. To do this, I suggest we fork classic-geth and replace Ethash with Keccak256. There are a few next steps:\r\n\r\n1. Research Keccak256 Algorithm ( I am currently still working on this)\r\n2. Replace Ethash in classic-geth with Keccak256.\r\n3. Create a testnet for miners to come and use.\r\n4. Monitor progress on testnet and collect data.",
