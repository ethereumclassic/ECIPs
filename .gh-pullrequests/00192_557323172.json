But I'll just need to do some tidy up work on the actual specifications before merging, as the thing presented in this PR is, IMO, unreadable.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, while 39-UNGAS itself currently looks not complex, it may actually require some refactorings in EVM, not yet sure the amount of work.
