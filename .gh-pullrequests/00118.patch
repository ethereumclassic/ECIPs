Subject: [PATCH 6/7] Update index.html

Changed string:

`<h4><a href="{{"erc"|relative_url}}">ERC</a> ({{site.specs|where:"lang","en"|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","ERC"|size}})</h4>`

to:

`<h4><a href="{{"ecbp"|relative_url}}">ECBP</a> ({{site.specs|where:"lang","en"|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","ECBP"|size}})</h4>`

Note: I am adding also a string for `networking` but I don't know if that will break the site. Please check before merging.

This is the new string I added (2 lines):

`<h4><a href="{{"networking"|relative_url}}">Networking</a> ({{site.specs|where:"lang","en"|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Networking"|size}})</h4>
<p>Improvements to networking protocol specifications.</p>`
