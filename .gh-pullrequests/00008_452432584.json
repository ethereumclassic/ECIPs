    "body": "I accept ASIC development to be an inevitability of a proof of work algorithm. Ethash was intended to be ASIC resistance and it was a failure. In my opinion, that means this approach of ASIC-resistance is prone to failure. Bitcoin has had no double-spends in its entire 10-year existence. For Ethereum Classic to grow in the future I believe:\r\n\r\n1. It needs to be the most profitable coin on the Keccak256 algorithm, which it would easily.\r\n2. ASICs need to be decentralized and easy to fabricate to ensure rapid decentralization. This is exactly like how Bitcoin's SHA-256 is very simple for many manufacturers to compete against each other.\r\n\r\nThe problem with a overly-engineered \"ASIC-Resistant\" algorithm, like ProgPoW, for example is that we have no idea that it is actually ASIC-resistant, and it's complicated, so if there is a bug in it, the company behind it would have an unfair advantage in producing it and stealth mining. \r\n\r\nA few individual responses:\r\n\r\n@drd34d - That design, of an ASIC is SHA-3, not Keccak256. I have observed the 0xBitcoin community work on Keccak256 miners, like [Cosmic](\"https://www.reddit.com/r/0xbitcoin/comments/8ttg2a/cosmic_miner_v401t_update_windows_64bit_nvidiacuda/\"). They do not have ASICs and they only have begun research on FPGAs.\r\n\r\n@oberondelafay - This ECIP is not about changing the consensus algorithm of the system (PoW vs. PoS). ETC is Proof of work right now, this proposal is about how we actually administer the mining algorithm.",
