Happy to talk about a sensible range though, I just cannot imagine any, yet.\r\n- It's six months because the change is substantial and we need all clients to implement it. You cannot switch to Keccak256 in a couple of weeks.\r\n- It makes sense to bump this to 90% if it appears to be controversial. However, this would mean that Ethash ASIC producers only need 10% of the ETC hashrate to ensure a change will never happen. It might be sensible to go with 70%.",
