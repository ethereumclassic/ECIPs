    "body": "@shanejonas Have you read the whole ECIP-1000? As I said previously, it contains this in its text:\r\n\r\n> We try to build consensus around an ECIP, but if thatâ€™s not possible, you can always submit a competing ECIP.\r\n\r\nThat provides enough justification for the creation of ECIP-1072, in the context of ECIP-1000.\r\n\r\nNow to answer why the sentence you provided is irrelevant:\r\n\r\n>  a single ECIP contain a single key proposal or new idea\r\n\r\nThis states the property of \"a single ECIP\". To put it in another word, a single ECIP should not contain multiple key proposals or ideas (in that case they should be split up).",
