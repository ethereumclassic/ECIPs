I failed to find any substance of what you're saying in that \"the author of the process does not understand the process\".\r\n\r\nThe two other approvals you got even  had an agreement with the objection https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/199#issuecomment-559185183. One of the approvals was also not from an ECIP editor. If you're suggesting you can get 3 people to form a dictatorship of Ethereum Classic and bypass any governance process, I'm happy to say you're wrong. :)",
