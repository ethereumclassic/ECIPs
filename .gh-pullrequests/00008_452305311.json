    "body": "@drd34d the whole point of ProgPow was to design an algo that uses so many of the GPU features that efficiency gains from a specialized ASIC (that you need to invent and manufacture) would be so little that it would not pay off.\r\n\r\nIn bitcoin's case, it came out with SHA256 and people developed ASICs for it. In progpow's case it's all upside down - it is an algorithm developed for an already existing \"ASIC\" chip. The best ASIC for it is a consumer GPU.\r\n\r\nKomodo's consensus algorithm is too different to bring it up in this discussion.\r\n\r\nWhat are the obvious reasons to distrust ETH as a \"verification point\" for how well a mining algorithm performs in the wild?",
