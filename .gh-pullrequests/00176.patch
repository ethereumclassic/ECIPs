 Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the
 _Istanbul_ hardforks. The proposed changes for Ethereum Classic's _Aztlán_ upgrade include:
 
-- TBD
+- Add Blake2 compression function `F` precompile
+- Reduce alt_bn128 precompile gas costs
+- Add ChainID opcode
+- Repricing for trie-size-dependent opcodes
+- Calldata gas cost reduction
+- Rebalance net-metered SSTORE gas cost with consideration of SLOAD gas cost change
 
 This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:
 
-- `TBD` on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet (TBD 2020)
-- `TBD` on Morden Classic PoW-testnet (TBD 2020)
-- `TBD` on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet (TBD 2020)
+- `TBD` on Mordor Classic PoW-testnet (Feb 5th, 2020)
+- `TBD` on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet (Feb 12th, 2020)
+- `TBD` on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet (March 25th, 2020)

 ### Motivation
 
 To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes shall be added to the Ethereum Classic
-networks, all of which have been in use on the Ethereum Foundation networks since late 2019.

+Both, the Geth Classic client and the Morden testnet will no longer be supported by the community and not recieve the Aztlán ugrades.

+- Users of the Geth Classic client are urged to migrate their services to Parity Ethereum, Multi-Geth, or Hyperledger Besu. It is no longer recommended to run Geth Classic in production.
+- Users of the Morden Classic testnet are urged to migrate their applications to the Kotti Classic or Morder Classic testnets.
