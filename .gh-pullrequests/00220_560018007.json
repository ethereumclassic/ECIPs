    "body": "@shanejonas I don't believe the last sentence was a correct representation of the actual meeting recording. Multiple community members have pointed out this. But anyway, yes, it's true now that everyone agreed moving forward with ECIP-1061! It's just the agreement was not on the call.\r\n\r\nStill, I must emphasis, ECIP-1072 is technically not a violation of ECIP process, but I respect whatever the community has decided. That's why ECIP-1072 is moved to withdrawn status!\r\n",
