I'm just looking for the documentation for the \"if there's agreement to do that in a call\" (which I'm assuming by which you mean \"rough consensus\" or establishing \"general agreement\") necessary procedure you're mentioning. \r\n\r\n> We can only move it to Last Call if there's agreement to do that in a call we should have as a community.\r\n> https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/232#issuecomment-560489730\r\n\r\n> We can only Reject it after we collectively agree in a call to do so.\r\n> https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/230#issuecomment-560488958\r\n\r\n>  If it is Rejected, that should be after a call between participants agreeing to Reject it. \r\n> https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/229#issuecomment-560488629\r\n\r\n> [ditto above]\r\n>  https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/231#issuecomment-560489250\r\n\r\nCan't seem to find the supportive procedural specification for these calls.\r\n\r\nI've found: \r\n\r\n> - Rejected - Reasons for rejecting ECIPs include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation, or obvious popular disapproval.\r\n> https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs#ecip-status-terms\r\n\r\nand the following diagram from https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs#process-overview:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20191203_102004](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45600330/70063861-7f2b5980-15b6-11ea-9747-9585b9f74c2c.png)\r\n\r\nRel #237 for wanting citation for `Last Call` follow-the-rules specification.
