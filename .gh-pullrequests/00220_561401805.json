    "body": "@YazzyYaz I don't think you can get away with the logic contradiction if we indeed agreed on ECIP-1061. Based on my notes and many others who attended the meeting, the decision was ECIP-1072, which I even clearly asked whether it is the case in the end. https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/177#issuecomment-560057744\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you want to say otherwise, you need to dispute the logic inconsistency. Otherwise it really have no substance.\r\n\r\nI don't know what you want to accomplish here by arguing a thing that's not even related to this PR -- we're talking about violation of ECIP-1061, and it's not even related to the discussion of ECIP-1061 vs ECIP-1072. I can only take this as you're so confident in the ECIP you're proposing that you think there's absolutely no issue in the specification or whatsoever. ",
