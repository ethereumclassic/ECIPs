    "body": "1. ECBP is a category of \"standard track\" ECIPs.\r\n2. As per ECIP-1000 you cannot move ECIP/ECBP from `Draft` to `Active`. `Active` can be used only instead of `Final`. And there is also `Last call` and `Accepted` state between `Draft` and `Final`.\r\n    > Some Informational ECIPs, which are considered process ECIPs, may also be moved to a status of `Active` instead of `Final` if they are never meant to be completed, e.g. this ECIP-1000.\r\n3. I agree that `Active` is not a proper state for this ECBP. ",
