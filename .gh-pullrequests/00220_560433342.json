    "body": "@meowsbits The history is left by others to interpret, but that's really not part of the ECIP process. The only violation of ECIP process until now, as far as I can tell, is what has been written in this PR. Other violations are either later corrected in subsequent PR, or closed. As a result, I think what is provided here is already as accurate and objective as possible.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is merged, we're back to the track that nothing has ever violated ECIP-1000, which is a really good thing.\r\n\r\nI don't see how #235 is related to this. It looks like more about providing history for past discussions, rather than ECIP-1000 process. \"History\" and \"justification for ECIP-1000\" are really two completely unrelated things.",
