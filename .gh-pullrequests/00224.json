    "body": "### TL;DR\r\n\r\nMake ECIPs with `Type` _Fork_ a thing, where _Fork_ ECIPs should follow this process:\r\n- A \"shell\" Fork ECIP is opened, fitting the [template provided](TODO). This ECIP __does not initially include `Activation Block Number` or `Features` specifications__.\r\n- While in `WIP` or `Draft` status, one or more change sets are proposed against this document (eg. via Github Pull Requests) __modifying BOTH `Activation Block Number` and `Features` specifications__.\r\n- ... Stuff happens; there are comments, emails, meetings, bribes, blogs, bragging, trolling, haranguing, arguing, debating, pondering, editing, compromising, constructive critique, etc...\r\n- One change set is merged to modify the Fork ECIP, yielding a COMPLETE and UNIQUE hard fork specification document, and status is moved to `Last Call`. By virtue of the process specification provided, a Fork ECIP achieving `Last Call` may not see `Draft` nor `WIP` status again (because doing so would require a merging a change set holding INCOMPLETE specification variables). \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated to and building from #223 , #222 , #221, #219 .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Discussion preamble from the author\r\n\r\nThis specification requires that Fork _Features_ and _Activation_ numbers are handled inextricably, and that once merged a Fork specification ECIP becomes finalized.\r\n\r\nThere are some important cases and implications to consider for this:\r\n- If, say, a Fork ECIP specification is finalized (having been fully specified with Activation Block Number and Feature Set via a merged change set)... BUT subsequently a bug is found during testing causing a loss of confidence in sucessfully achieving the fork at the specified block number, then the Fork ECIP would want to be `Deferred` or `Withdrawn` or `Rejected`, and then eventually replaced with a new UNIQUE ECIP containing a revised Activation Block Number and possibly also Feature Set parameters. \r\n\r\n- Change sets (here, Pull Requests) are expected to take on a more considerable role for Fork specification development; proposed Feature Set + Activation schedule should be documented explicitly and then discussed relatively. Sensible use of Github's linking tools (Issue/PR references) should be used liberally, and it would probably be good establish a practical naming scheme for proposed Fork ECIP modifications (eg. `FORK-ECIP-9999 Spec: <My features> @ <My block>`) ",
