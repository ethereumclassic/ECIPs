    "body": "@YazzyYaz Again, mixing the water doesn't help your situation. As I have repeatedly said, none of the actions of creating competing ECIPs ever close violated the ECIP process. We clearly could not build consensus on ECIP-1061 when Afri tried to merge EIPs in without community consensus https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/176#pullrequestreview-317026547.\r\n\r\nEven if there're violations (and I want to make it clear, there're not in ECIP-1072), all affecting ECIPs have been moved to withdrawn status, which means their courses have already been corrected (if there're things to correct, but I want to note there are not). If you're fine to move ECIP-1061 to withdrawn status, I'll definitely agree with you that this PR is not needed. Otherwise, ECIP-1061 itself constitutes an irregular process transition.",
