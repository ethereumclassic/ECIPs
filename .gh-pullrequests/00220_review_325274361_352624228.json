In this section, we document irregular process transitions, and give special permissions to them, to state that they followed the process.

At the time, Afri dismissed a review of clear objections from ECIP editor Wei Tang, without waiting for consultations of the community, or resolutions with the review submitter. We here declare that this particular action from Afri followed the ECIP process. ",

Should we remove it from that place first, if @soc1c does not want himself to be associated as Afri?\r\n\r\nI disagree with the rest of the points you’re trying to make in the post. Irregular transition is there because it’s.. irregular. The thing is, we have to have irregular state transition if we want past editing actions to be justified. Otherwise, specs like 1061 will just become invalid. I guess you do not want to see that.\r\n\r\nI do agree that irregular transitions should only be added in really extreme cases, like what we have now. I don’t think we can give objective criteria for it — the same as we cannot give objective criteria for theDAO.",
