    "body": "@phyro There are two points you are making, one I agree with and one I disagree with:\r\n\r\n1. I agree that switching algorithms frequently is a bad idea. Every-time we do this it is very disruptive to the entire community, and changes need to be thoroughly tested in lab conditions before we make a drastic switch. Research has definitively proven that Keccak256 is currently the best hashing algorithm available, hence why it is SHA3 certified. I would trust SHA3 with my life. I am very skeptical Ethash is even safe against a determined opponent like a nationstate.\r\n\r\n2. The issue in the long run as I see it, is that friendly miners were not able to have more hashpower than hostile miners. With a more transparent mining algorithm, the market is on a much more level playing field. What Ethash has created is a market where incumbent manufacturers take advantage of poor documentation and confusion to gain a competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nKeccak 256 Documentation: https://keccak.team/files/Keccak-implementation-3.2.pdf\r\nEthash Documentation: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash",
