    "body": "@shanejonas We're talking about violations of the ECIP process in this PR. I don't think whether preferring one meta ECIP or multiple meta ECIP matters here at all, as long as you follow the process to discuss it. In fact, I do think we have many community members who would prefer having only one meta ECIP from now on, but there's indeed also an alternative proposal https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/219\r\n\r\nCurrently, both having one meta ECIP, and having multiple meta ECIPs align with the ECIP process.\r\n\r\nThe intention of this PR is rather to provide justification for all of our past ECIP process actions. So in contrary to @YazzyYaz's claim, this is certainly not a joke.",
