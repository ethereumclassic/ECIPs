    "body": "We will also need DCOs from all existing contributors (should not require \"decloaking\" for any pseudonymous prior contributors) and confirmation that they agree to the relicensing.  The copyright sits with the contributors, not with the repository.   We need everyone's consent to relicense, but I think this a GREAT approach.   Let me stew on it and come back with feedback.   Will also raise with the IP lawyers for their input.",
