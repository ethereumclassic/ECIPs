Its sole purpose is specifying a process how to openly determine and select a mining algorithm for Ethereum Classic.\n+\n+### Motivation\n+The decision to change the Ethereum Classic mining algorithm - or to keep it as is - is not an easy one to make. It should be done by broad consensus with all stakeholders involved - miners, investors, application and core developers, and anyone else who feels having a stake in ETC. This meta document proposes a process of how to facilitate the potential change of the mining algorithm and parameters.",
