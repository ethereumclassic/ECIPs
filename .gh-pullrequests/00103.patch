+### Title
+
+    ECIP: 69769
+    Title: Submit Block RPC
+    Author: Zachary Belford, zachary.b@etclabs.org
+    Discussions-To: Community Discord #ecips
+    Status: Draft
+    Type: Standards Track
+    Created: 2019-06-26
+
+### Abstract
+
+Add an RPC method to submit a new block, instead of having to use submitWork.
+
+### Motivation
+
+I would like to be able to submitWork, but have the address used be one other than the etherbase of the node the work is being submitted by.
+
+### Specification
+
+```json
+{
+  "openrpc": "1.1.8",
+  "info": {
+    "version": "1.0.0",
+    "title": "Example submitBlock"
+  },
+  "methods": [
+    {
+      "name": "eth_submitBlock",
+      "summary": "Submit a new block proposal",
+      "description": "Given a new block, it will validate the block, and broadcast it to connected peers.",
+      "params": [
+        { "$ref": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/etclabscore/ethereum-json-rpc-specification/master/openrpc.json#/components/contentDescriptors/Block" }
+      ],
+      "result": {
+        "name": "isBlockAccepted",
+        "schema": {
+          "type": "boolean"
+        }
+      }
+    }
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+### Rationale
+
+This removes the dependency for miners to have a geth node with accounts that need to be unlocked. Miners would be able to better isolate their private keys from the world, yeilding better security potential.
+
+### Implementation
+
+I think it's pretty straight forward. Looking at the above specification, we would be adding a eth_submitBlock rpc method. It's similar to eth_submitWork, except with fewer steps before broadcasting the block. 
+
+
+
+**NOTE: I am extremely open to suggestions for this. Please be liberal in your feedback. Thank you.**
