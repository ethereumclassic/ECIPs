    "body": "A good counter-point to ProgPow is that since it's relatively easy to own/rent more GPU hashpower (i.e. a botnet or mining pools) then any ProgPow chain will become more vulnerable to 51% than before - and thus ProgPow is a trojan horse.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should embrace ASICs, but make manufacturing them so easy that no one company gets a monopoly on them. If all three of\r\n\r\n* ETC picks an easily ASIC'able algo\r\n* ASICs are manufactured my many competing companies without price fixing and are easy to buy and run\r\n* ETC is the top coin on this algo measured by hashrate\r\n\r\nthen we may consider it secure.",
