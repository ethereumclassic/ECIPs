    "body": "I apologize I realized for personal reasons I don't think I can guarantee my availability to act as a coordinator systematically, this is why I decided to take my name out.\r\n\r\nI understand that position is unique to what I was doing informally and may be confused with \"editor\". The difference is that \"editor\" is a technical position and \"coordinator\" is a non-technical position more focused on advancing the ECIP process, when editors have limited time.\r\n\r\nI will close this PR as I will not continue to lead it. If the position is needed someone else can open a PR, but I haven't seen other people doing that role in the recent past.",
