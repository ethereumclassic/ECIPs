    "body": "SHA-3, having a faster less memory intensive algorithm might make ASICs run up against transistor limits sooner, really simplifies the chip, more production. I only have a naive knowledge of this but the maximum speed of CPUs seems to be running up against limits faster than RAM.\r\n\r\nI'm personally iffy about changing the PoW algorithm at all (unless an exploit is found) but it's worth noting.\r\n\r\nAlso in this vein SHA-3 would be much less likely to be exploitable than Ethash due to its long period of development and analysis.",
