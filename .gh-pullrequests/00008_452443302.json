This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the community needs to be aware before the decision is made.\r\n\r\n@oberondelafay if you have ideas of what consensus algorithm can guarantee uninterrupted decentralized operation of *code is law* smart contract platform I'm sure this community would love to hear that. I don't think that we can do better than PoW in this aspect though.",
