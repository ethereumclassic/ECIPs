Miners would be able to better isolate their private keys from the world, yeilding better security potential.\n+\n+### Implementation\n+\n+I think it's pretty straight forward. Looking at the above specification, we would be adding a eth_submitBlock rpc method. It's similar to eth_submitWork, except with fewer steps before broadcasting the block. \n+\n+\n+\n+**NOTE: I am extremely open to suggestions for this. Please be liberal in your feedback. Thank you.**",
