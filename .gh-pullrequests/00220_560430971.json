    "body": "The crux of what, as I understand it, may be our failure to agree -- is the interpretation of \"events.\" As it were, I may indeed agree that the \"event\" or \"events\" you've cited as the _Irregular Process_ is accurate. \r\n\r\nBut I feel that it represents an incomplete history of a complex set of very many \"events\" which are left undocumented. This is why I said `conditions and content are insufficient to qualify as an objective representation of affairs`.\r\n\r\nPlease see https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/235 for an approach to providing a nearer-complete justification and availably-objective view of \"events,\" which may be able to satisfy your wish for [\"to provide justifications in ECIP-1000 for what has happened in the past.\"](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/220#issuecomment-560420766)\r\n",
