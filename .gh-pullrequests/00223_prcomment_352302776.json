A Forking Meta ECIP should be conceptally complete and unique (_next hardfork_ suffices for uniqueness, since there can only be one).\n \n _Complete_ is defined as being fully and totally definitive; not lacking anything.\n \n _Unique_ means not the same as another thing; in this case, not precisely duplicating any existing ECIP.\n \n-This proposal specifies that all Forking Meta ECIPs should be COMPLETE and UNIQUE; essentially disallowing `Draft` status Forking Meta ECIPs and and/or meaningful revisions (set ECIPs, block number).\n-\n-This implies that a valid Forking Meta ECIP must contain a full and complete set of to-be included ECIPs, and a definitive block number. \n+This proposal specifies that all Forking Meta ECIPs in `Draft` state or earlier should contain NO information about ECIP-sets or block activation numbers (all `TBD`). Proposed specifications to fill these placeholders should be made in the form of distinct and separate propsed change sets (eg Github Pull Requests) to the Forking Meta ECIP document. The changesets are required to be UNIQUE and COMPLETE.\n \n ### Rationale\n \n The sole purpose of a Forking Meta ECIP is to join a block number with a set of `n >= 1` ECIPs containing protocol-facing changes. The document says \"_These_ features will activate at _this_ moment.\"\n \n-0. __Fill-in-the-blank ECIPs are not in good form.__ Forking Meta ECIPs are themselves ECIPs, and their job is to define, with certainty and clarity, technical specifications. Forking Meta ECIPs that essentially leave either field `Block number` and/or field `ECIP set` blank are functionally useless (inoperable); they say only: \"(I/we) propose to have some fork at some time.\" An analogue of blankness to non-Forking-Meta ECIPs would essentially say \"TODO: put my next awesome feature specification here.\" \n+0. \"Shell\" format Forking Meta ECIPs represent a clear, albeit abstract, idea: The blockchain's next hard fork.\n \n-1. __Demanding fully-formed Forking Meta ECIP proposals forces authors, editors, and reviewers to evaluate and document ECIP-set behavior and enables concrete discussion of feature sets as complete wholes.__ A Forking Meta ECIP may represent a plurality of features, and so in order to be an _operable_ specification it should not represent an ambiguous set. Sets of ECIPs can have interoperative dependencies and outcomes; this causes a conceptual permutation and combination challenge when attempting to design a set of ECIPs for simultaneous inclusion. \n+1. __Demanding fully-formed Forking Meta ECIP Changeset proposal forces authors, editors, and reviewers to evaluate and document ECIP-set behavior and enables concrete discussion of feature sets as complete wholes.__ A Forking Meta ECIP Changeset may represent a plurality of features, and so in order to be an _operable_ specification it should not represent an ambiguous set. Sets of ECIPs can have interoperative dependencies and outcomes; this causes a conceptual permutation and combination challenge when attempting to design a set of ECIPs for simultaneous inclusion. \n \n-2. __Forking Meta ECIPs without block numbers lack operability.__ Activation numbers _are specifications_ and should not be treated as a second class or at-convenience citizens. Implementation timelines are importantly related variables to their adjacent ECIP-sets (large set ostensibly require long timelines, hotfix sets require short ones.) We cannot reason about them in isolation.\n+2. __Forking Meta ECIP Changesets without block numbers lack operability.__ Activation numbers _are specifications_ and should not be treated as a second class or at-convenience citizens.

It may not undergo any meaningful changes once receiving `Last Call` status (its next status beyond `WIP`).\n+A Forking Meta ECIP may only achieve `Last Call` status once a Changeset has been accepted and all other alternative marked as `Deferred`, `Withdrawn`, or `Rejected`.\n \n-Procedurally, compared to the historical and traditional practice of opening an essentially empty Forking Meta ECIP and working to fill in blanks, this proposed procedure makes only marginal and changes, demanding only that what was taken as implication, subtext, or conteext before now be made explicit. Rather than reviewing actual-or-theoretical proposed change sets to an ECIP (which sadly, have historically usually been theoretical), this forces proposed Forking Meta ECIP alternative outcomes to assume a fully qualified and standardized formats before becoming eligible for consideration. \n+This proposed procedure makes only marginal and changes, demanding only that what was taken as implication, subtext, or conteext before now be made explicit.
