    "body": "> But anyway, the issue with irregular process transition is not that whether we want it, but that it has already happened.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes an addition of an [`Appendix: Irregular Process Transitions`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/220/files#diff-db096127a5d72fa17bed19fc86636d80R356) which did not exist before, as well as a first entry in this presumed section describing a view of events which (thankfully, and hopefully every-quickenly) are indeed becoming historical. \r\n\r\nAs I see it, this PR's content must necessarily be broken into two pieces:\r\n\r\n1. Add a section `### Appendix: Irregular Process Transitions`, drafting it's procedures and specifications. \r\n2. __Once and if that is accepted__, allow entries to be proposed for inclusion.",
