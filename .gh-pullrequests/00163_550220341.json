    "body": "> What is your proposal regarding requiring real names for devs.\r\n\r\nThis is a seperate matter IMO. Let's keep it to one thing at a time.\r\n\r\n> Several are cc0 licensed in the footer of the ecip\r\n\r\nAh i didnt see this, thanks for pointing it out. As it doesn't adhere to the specification laid out in ECIP-1000, I'd propose that its an invalid ECIP anyways, and thus should be removed and re-filled.\r\n\r\n> And the fact many ECIPs (the ones moved to \"Last Call\", \"final\" or \"active\" I guess are the important ones) don't have a license doesn't mean there has to be a blanket license and say goodbye to anyone who doesn't like it if there are other licenses that are ok as per ECIP-1000....\r\n\r\nApache 2.0 being a permissive license allows for anyone to maintain a fork which is re-licensed under anything they want. Freedom of use is the goal here, right? I thought I could get by without having to actually argue for why Apache 2.0 is the most suitable license for this repository. There is a lot of writing on this matter, but generally takeaways are:\r\n\r\n1. dont invent your own licenses\r\n2. there is barely any legal precedent for most of OSS anyways, so its really just best guess here. see above-linked google's open source casebook\r\n3. Copyleft is counterproductive in terms of collaboration with 99% of good developers: the ones with jobs.\r\n\r\nNot including a license (like we have been) is great, but it also means there is no statement of liability or warranty. This is not good.\r\n\r\nThe concept of using a term such as \"Apache 2.0+\" is IMO an anti-pattern. If you didn't care about the version, why would you say 2.0 then.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing that we stick to Apache 2.0, keep things simple, and stop yack shaving on this BS.",
