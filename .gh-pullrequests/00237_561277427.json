    "body": "@husainfazel As I said previously, there are several fatal logic inconsistencies if the last dev call consensus indeed reached on ECIP-1061. You can read more about that here https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/177#issuecomment-560057744\r\n\r\nNote that so far no one has been able to provide any objections to those logic inconsistencies of ECIP-1061.\r\n\r\nThe first comment you posted also misread an important part of ECIP-1000:\r\n\r\n> We try to build consensus around an ECIP, but if thatâ€™s not possible, you can always submit a competing ECIP.\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't think anyone has been able to provide valid reasons to object the last dev meeting's decision -- ECIP-1072. If you have one, let me know, otherwise, please don't spam the repo any more.",
