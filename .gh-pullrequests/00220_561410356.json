    "body": "> Also, the Code of Conduct is still in Draft stage, which I hope you can recall means its subject to change as defined in the ECIP-1000 document. If it's in Active stage, that's different.\r\n\r\nRight, but I'm pointing out you're violating the document you just wrote.\r\n\r\nYour action is a personal attack. Can you point it out to me which sentence in this PR did I try to \"slander\" Afri? All what I said is Afri's action is justified. And as I also said and pointed out by others (like @phyro), Afri, as an editor, is known by the community. If it can be clarified that Afri only want to be referred to by its anonymous handle in ECIP-1000, then I will definitely be fine replacing Afri with @soc1c after https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/236 is merged.",
