I have updated [my comment](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/220#issuecomment-560425017), removing the \"subject~~ive~~\" part. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20191202_103919](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45600330/69972738-23969880-14f0-11ea-9935-bf5d746a9dfc.png)\r\n\r\nCan you address the concern listed below, calling for the PR to be broken into two pieces? As you know (probably better than anyone), modifications to EIP-1000 must not be taken trivially or lightly. \r\n\r\nThe most important part for me is establishing in the documentation procedural specifications for handling proposed modifications to the suggested Irregular Process Transitions appendix section, since this section is... well, Irregular... and thus may call for additional or modified specifications different from the basic specs for general ECIP change sets.
