    "body": "After reviewing all 127 BIPS, the Bitcoin BIP situation is similar to ECIP:\r\n\r\n• Older BIPs (2011-2015) are not licensed or use `PD`\r\n• In the \"middle ages\" (2015-2016) BIPs are mainly `PD`, which was later discouraged by BIP-0002 <- the equivalent of ECIP-1000 \r\n• Newer BIPs (as from 2017) they all comply with BIP-0002 and all use formats such as `BSD-3-Clause | CC0-1.0` combined, just `BSD-2-Clause` or `CC0-1.0`\r\n\r\nSummary: older BIPs are unlicensed or `PD`. Middle ages BIPs are `PD`. Everything in 2017 and after is licensed using best practices in BIP-0002.",
