We SHOULD NOT merge it until we have resolution on all the outstanding issues - specifically getting consent from all prior contributors - because addition of a repo-level license is re-licensing - and the copyright lies with the original authors.   It was not \"assigned\".\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I think this is the best approach.  We are making rapid progress.",
