As mentioned in https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/199#pullrequestreview-323755348 and echoed by https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/199#issuecomment-559185183, it's better to move this to withdrawn status to avoid unnecessary duplication.\r\n\r\nI believe I have the rights to propose the withdrawn status because I'm listed as an author of this ECIP. :)",
