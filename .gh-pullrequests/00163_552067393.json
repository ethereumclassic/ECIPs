    "body": "\"Allowing Apache 2.0 as the root license so ETC has a default option, but having a more extended list in ECIP-1000 that allows devs to use alternatives, but perhaps post them in another repo or site e.g. ecips.that.world as @sorpaas has done in the past.\"\r\n\r\nAs long as those other repos are suitably constrained to have to use one of a very short list of acceptable alternatives, which I think likely boils down to only Apache 2.0 or the new Chinese license.   So maybe we end up with another repo for proposals using that license, like @kimisan has said he would prefer?   But we really don't want loads of repos, because it makes it horrible for people to work out where everything is.\r\n\r\nAlso - even just to add the Apache 2.0 license in the root here, we still need to get consent from the previous contributors - with my spreadsheet and Donald's getting close to that already.",
