Just the need to do the \"register your name and email address\" the first time any of your changes are committed.\r\n\r\nAnybody can create issues with no barrier.\r\nAnybody can still comment on anything with no barrier.\r\nAnybody can still create pull requests with no barrier.  They just cannot be merged until you register your name (which could be pseudonym) and email address - so you can be contacted in the future.",
