Its sole purpose is specifying a process how to openly determine and select a mining algorithm for Ethereum Classic.\n+\n+### Motivation\n+The decision to change the Ethereum Classic mining algorithm - or to keep it as is - is not an easy one to make. It should be done by broad consensus with all stakeholders involved - miners, investors, application and core developers, and anyone else who feels having a stake in ETC. This meta document proposes a process of how to facilitate the potential change of the mining algorithm and parameters.\n+\n+### Available Options\n+Currently, the following options are debatable.\n+\n+- **ECBP-1076-A**: _\"Ethash Status Quo.\"_ The mining algorithm will be untouched as it is since genesis, as **Ethash** function with a statically **increasing DAG**.\n+- **ECBP-1076-B**: _\"Ethash Limited DAG.\"_ The mining algorithm will be untouched as it is since genesis, as **Ethash** function. However, the **DAG size will be limited** as specified in [ECIP-1043](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1043).\n+- **ECBP-1076-C**: _\"Keccak256 (SHA3).\"_ The mining algorithm will be **changed to Keccak256** as specified in [ECIP-1049](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1049).\n+- **ECBP-1076-D**: _\"ProgPoW.\"_ The mining algorithm will be **changed to ProgPow** as specified in [ECIP-1070](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1070).\n+\n+Eventually, the community has to decide on one.\n+\n+### Process\n+The following process facilitates all stakeholders in various stages.\n+\n+1. _\"Tech Stage.\"_ Core and application developers meet in regular calls to evaluate the feasibility of the Ethash status quo, the limited DAG size proposal (ECIP-1043), the Keccak256 proposal (ECIP-1049), and the ProgPoW proposal (ECIP-1070).\n+\n+    If there is no technical objection to each of the proposals, the proposals can be **moved to \"Last Call\"** state, regardless of whether they will be considered in future or not. As a result, none, one, or many competing proposals can be in \"Last Call\" state at the same time.\n+\n+    This stage is finished once all proposals are either in \"Last Call,\" \"Withdrawn,\" or \"Rejected\" state.\n+\n+2. _\"Miner Stage.\"_ Solo miners, mining farms, and mining pools can signal support by adjusting their mining node to signal in favor of one of the proposals that was promoted to \"Last Call\" state in the previous stage. Details on the signaling can be found in the subsequent section.",
