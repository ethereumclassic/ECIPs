    "body": "@BelfordZ \r\n\r\n>Should this be a deal breaker for you folks, I'm happy to meet halfway, adding root license of apache 2.0, allowing other licenses to be specified, but I would urge that any GNU, GPL, or as I put, politically infused licenses not be included in the allowable list.\r\n\r\nYes, let's meet in the middle. Allowing Apache 2.0 as the root license so ETC has a default option, but having a more extended list in ECIP-1000 that allows devs to use alternatives, but perhaps post them in another repo or site e.g. ecips.that.world as @sorpaas has done in the past.\r\n\r\nThe ETC ecosystem can use ECIP-1000 in this Github Organization (https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/blob/master/_specs/ecip-1000.md) as the canonical reference of which licenses to use.\r\n\r\n@BelfordZ can you point out which licenses in ECIP-1000 are hyper-toxic to you?\r\n\r\nI just speak for myself here, others may have other opinions.
