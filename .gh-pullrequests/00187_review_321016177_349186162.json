Its sole purpose is specifying a process how to openly determine and select a mining algorithm for Ethereum Classic.\n+\n+### Motivation\n+The decision to change the Ethereum Classic mining algorithm - or to keep it as is - is not an easy one to make. It should be done by broad consensus with all stakeholders involved - miners, investors, application and core developers, and anyone else who feels having a stake in ETC. This meta document proposes a process of how to facilitate the potential change of the mining algorithm and parameters.\n+\n+### Available Options\n+Currently, the following options are debatable.\n+\n+- **ECBP-1076-A**: _\"Ethash Status Quo.\"_ The mining algorithm will be untouched as it is since genesis, as **Ethash** function with a statically **increasing DAG**.\n+- **ECBP-1076-B**: _\"Ethash Limited DAG.\"_ The mining algorithm will be untouched as it is since genesis, as **Ethash** function. However, the **DAG size will be limited** as specified in [ECIP-1043](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1043).\n+- **ECBP-1076-C**: _\"Keccak256 (SHA3).\"_ The mining algorithm will be **changed to Keccak256** as specified in [ECIP-1049](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1049).\n+- **ECBP-1076-D**: _\"ProgPoW.\"_ The mining algorithm will be **changed to ProgPow** as specified in [ECIP-1070](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1070).\n+\n+Eventually, the community has to decide on one.\n+\n+### Process\n+The following process facilitates all stakeholders in various stages.",
