### Abstract

This extends [BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) for public addresses on the Ethereum Classic network. As an example, address `0xdf7d7e053933b5cc24372f878c90e62dadad5d42` becomes `term-typical-life-include-deputy-toward-move-tourist-maple-goose-define-forget-suspect-push-any`.

### Specification

The address is taken as a bytearray. A checksum is generated by taking the first 5 bits of the SHA256 hash of the address. This checksum is appended to the end of the bytearray. Next, these concatenated bits are split into groups of 11 bits, each encoding a number from 0-2047, serving as an index into a wordlist. Finally, we convert these numbers into words and use the joined words as a mnemonic sentence.

Words are connected by `-` in English and other Latin languages. There's currently no defined scheme for non-Latin languages like Chinese.

### Wordlist

We use the same word list as in BIP-39.
