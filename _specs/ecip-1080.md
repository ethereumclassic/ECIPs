### Simple Summary

This is a standalone ECIP for the addition of the SELFBALANCE opcode.  This opcode
was added to the ETH protocol as part of the broader [EIP 1884: Repricing for trie-size-dependent opcodes](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) which was activated in the [Instanbul hardfork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1679).  The 1884 EIP was rejected during the
[ETC Core Developers call](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/177) on 27th November 2019 because
it broke backwards compatbility, but in this case the baby was accidentally thrown out with the bathwater.


### Abstract

This ECIP is a standalone SELFBALANCE specification, which would be implemented
as part of the "Phoenix" hardfork which would either ["fix" Aztlán](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/262)
or would [replace Aztlán](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/264).

The network participants who took part in the
[ETC Core Developers call](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/177) on 27th November 2019
were under the impression at the time that the scope we agreed ("Instanbul without the
backward-compatibility breaking parts of EIP-1884") - ECIP-1061 / ECIP-1072 - would move the ETC
protocol to a place where it was 100% compatible with the ETH mainnet.


### Specification

Thanks to [Wei Tang](https://github.com/sorpaas) for
[identifying the mis-specification](https://ethereum.corepaper.org/fork/istanbul/#ethereum-classic) and
for providing his recommendation on how to [rectify it](https://specs.corepaper.org/50-selfbalance).

- A new opcode, `SELFBALANCE` is introduced at `0x47`. 
  - `SELFBALANCE` pops `0` arguments off the stack, 
  - `SELFBALANCE` pushes the `balance` of the current address to the stack,
  - `SELFBALANCE` is priced as `GasFastStep`, at `5` gas. 


### Rationale

See [EIP 1884: Repricing for trie-size-dependent opcodes](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) for
the original rationale for the gas-repricings for ETH.

These changes are sensible, but they [broke 680 deployed Aragon smart contracts](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-istanbul-upgrade-will-break-680-smart-contracts-on-aragon) along with various other deployed
smart contacts by applying the repricings retroactively and unconditionally.

This new opcode does not break backwards compatibility.  For compatibility with ETH it is both
necessary and desirable.


### Implementation

The following clients with Ethereum Classic support already implement the SELFBALANCE opcode, but
not in this standalone form yet.  The work to support standalone would be minimal.

- Parity Ethereum
- Multi-Geth
- Hyperledger Besu
