### Simple Summary

This ECIP defines the Ethereum Classic Funding Proposal (ECFP) process — a standardized, open framework for requesting protocol-level funding from the Olympia Treasury via the Olympia DAO. ECFPs enable developers, infrastructure providers, researchers, and community contributors to propose and justify their work in a transparent, permissionless, and reproducible format, ensuring treasury funds are allocated fairly and in alignment with network goals.

### Abstract

This ECIP establishes the Ethereum Classic Funding Proposal (ECFP) process as the canonical submission format and lifecycle for funding requests to the Olympia Treasury, governed by the Olympia DAO. ECFPs serve as the primary interface between builders and Ethereum Classic’s protocol-level funding system, providing structure, clarity, and accountability for all requests.

An ECFP defines the problem to be solved, the scope of work, the requested funding amount, the recipient(s), milestones, and expected outcomes. The process includes public discussion, on-chain governance voting, and transparent fund disbursement upon approval.

The ECFP format is designed to be accessible, reproducible, and auditable by any member of the community, enabling sustainable funding of core development, infrastructure, ecosystem tools, and public goods that benefit Ethereum Classic’s long-term health and decentralization.

### Motivation

Ethereum Classic has historically struggled to coordinate funding for public goods — including client development, infrastructure, documentation, security audits, and educational resources. Funding decisions were often made off-chain, behind closed doors, or by centralized entities with limited transparency or accountability to the broader community.

With the activation of the Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112) and the governance system established by Olympia DAO (ECIP-1113), Ethereum Classic now possesses a decentralized, protocol-native funding mechanism. However, to ensure this system is effective, the network must adopt a standardized process for requesting, reviewing, and approving proposals.

The ECFP format solves this by:

- **Codifying the Proposal Lifecycle**: From submission to voting to disbursement, each step is clearly defined and permissionless.
- **Encouraging Ecosystem Participation**: Anyone can submit an ECFP — not just well-connected teams or insiders.
- **Increasing Transparency and Accountability**: Proposals are published on-chain or via verifiable sources and tracked publicly.
- **Reducing Governance Overhead**: Standardized formats help voters evaluate proposals more efficiently and make consistent decisions.
- **Creating Institutional Memory**: Approved and rejected proposals are permanently archived, enabling future contributors to learn from past decisions.

The ECFP process is modeled after the successful ECIP governance framework and adapts it for funding purposes, enabling Ethereum Classic to fund itself — transparently and sustainably — for the first time in its history.

### Specification

The Ethereum Classic Funding Proposal (ECFP) process is defined as a structured, standardized lifecycle for submitting, evaluating, voting on, and executing proposals for protocol-level funding from the Olympia Treasury. It SHALL be enforced at the governance layer by the Olympia DAO (ECIP-1113) and recorded on-chain for transparency.

#### ECFP Lifecycle

1. **Proposal Submission**

   - Proposals SHALL be submitted by any Ethereum Classic account through the Olympia DAO governance interface.
   - Each proposal MUST include:
     - Proposal title and ECFP number (assigned automatically or sequentially)
     - Author name(s) and contact
     - Requested funding amount (in ETC)
     - Recipient address
     - Purpose, scope of work, and expected impact
     - Disbursement schedule (e.g. milestone-based, linear vesting, lump sum)
     - Relevant deliverables and KPIs
     - Off-chain metadata link (e.g. IPFS or Arweave document for full proposal)

2. **Proposal Statuses**

   Each proposal MUST pass through the following statuses:

   - `Draft`: Submitted and open for discussion but not yet eligible for voting.
   - `Active`: Undergoing on-chain voting during a defined voting window.
   - `Approved`: Passed voting thresholds and eligible for execution.
   - `Rejected`: Failed to meet quorum or approval threshold.
   - `Executed`: Funds have been disbursed via Olympia Treasury.
   - `Expired`: Not voted on within the proposal's valid period.

3. **Voting and Quorum**

   - Voting SHALL be conducted via Olympia DAO using a token-weighted or delegated stake mechanism.
   - Proposals MUST meet a minimum quorum (e.g., 5% of eligible voting power) and approval threshold (e.g., 60% yes votes).
   - Voting period and delay SHALL be configurable by DAO governance.

4. **Execution and Disbursement**

   - Upon approval, the DAO contract SHALL schedule the associated disbursement to the recipient via the Olympia Treasury’s `release()` or `execute()` functions.
   - Disbursement MAY be time-locked or milestone-based.
   - Execution MUST emit a `ProposalExecuted` event with relevant metadata.

5. **Amendments and Withdrawals**

   - Proposals MAY be amended or withdrawn by the original author before entering the `Active` state.
   - Once a proposal is `Active`, it CANNOT be changed, only voted on.

6. **Transparency and Indexing**

   - All proposals and their statuses SHALL be recorded on-chain.
   - A public dashboard or explorer MAY be maintained to track proposal history, disbursements, and results.

#### Governance Scope and Legal Interface

The Ethereum Classic Funding Proposal (ECFP) process defines the **exclusive pathway** for all disbursements from the Olympia Treasury. This ensures funding decisions are consistent, transparent, and governed entirely through on-chain mechanisms.

**Scope of Governance:**

- The ECFP process SHALL be binding for **all treasury disbursements**, including:
  - Core development funding  
  - Emergency withdrawals  
  - Recurring budgets  
  - Multi-phase or milestone-based grants
- Olympia DAO MAY introduce specialized ECFP categories (e.g., Operational ECFPs, Treasury Management ECFPs) with tailored review workflows and eligibility criteria.
- No funds MAY be disbursed outside the ECFP lifecycle.

#### Legal Interface: Ethereum Classic DAO LLC

While governance decisions and treasury execution occur entirely **on-chain**, Ethereum Classic requires a compliant interface for recipients needing fiat settlement, tax reporting, or legal contracting. These off-chain functions SHALL be handled by the **Ethereum Classic DAO LLC**, a Wyoming-registered entity established under the **Wyoming DAO LLC Act (2021 Wyo. Sess. Laws Ch. 151)**.

This structure enables legal compatibility without compromising the decentralization or sovereignty of the DAO.

**Legal Role and Boundaries:**

- The DAO LLC functions solely as an **administrative executor**, not a decision-maker.
- All disbursement instructions MUST originate from successful on-chain proposals.
- The DAO LLC MUST:
  - Perform fiat conversions, KYC/AML onboarding, and tax filings as needed  
  - Engage contractors in accordance with DAO votes  
  - Adhere to compliance laws without altering DAO decisions

---

#### Wyoming Legal Protections and Operating Constraints

The DAO LLC is **legally bound** by its Operating Agreement to uphold the decisions of the Olympia DAO. The Wyoming DAO LLC Act provides enforceable recognition that **on-chain governance holds primacy** over the legal entity.

**Enforceable Constraints:**

- The DAO LLC SHALL NOT:
  - Hold treasury keys or act as a signer on treasury funds  
  - Approve, reject, or modify any ECFP  
  - Veto or delay execution of valid DAO decisions  
- The Operating Agreement SHALL:
  - Require strict execution of DAO-approved disbursements  
  - Forbid discretion in reviewing or amending funding decisions  
  - Establish DAO tokenholder governance as the LLC’s controlling body

**Accountability and Redress Mechanisms:**

- If the DAO LLC fails to execute approved instructions or breaches its mandate:
  - DAO governance MAY reassign administrative duties to a new contractor or legal wrapper  
  - The DAO MAY vote to amend the Operating Agreement to reinforce alignment  
  - Legal action MAY be pursued under Wyoming law for breach of fiduciary duty

---

**Summary:**  
By anchoring off-chain execution to both **code and corporate law**, Ethereum Classic ensures that treasury operations remain decentralized, lawful, and resistant to interference. The DAO LLC is accountable to the DAO — not the reverse — enabling the Olympia funding process to scale without sacrificing sovereignty.

### Rationale

The Ethereum Classic Funding Proposal (ECFP) process formalizes a community-governed method for allocating protocol-level funds from the Olympia Treasury. This structure ensures funding decisions are transparent, inclusive, and aligned with the Ethereum Classic network’s long-term values.


Key reasons for defining the ECFP process include:

- **Clarity and Accountability**  
  By standardizing how proposals are submitted, voted on, and executed, the ECFP process eliminates ambiguity and ensures all stakeholders understand how funds are allocated. Clear expectations for proposal content and deliverables enhance accountability.

- **Transparency and Auditability**  
  The entire proposal lifecycle is executed on-chain. This ensures all funding decisions, disbursements, and outcomes are verifiable by any network participant, reducing the risks of favoritism, mismanagement, or opaque grants.

- **Openness and Neutrality**  
  Anyone — including independent developers, infrastructure teams, researchers, or content creators — can participate in the funding process. This removes historical barriers to entry and promotes merit-based contributions to Ethereum Classic.

- **Governance Modularity**  
  By defining the ECFP process independently of the DAO’s implementation, Ethereum Classic can upgrade governance mechanisms over time without altering the principles or procedures of the funding process.

- **Alignment with ETC Principles**  
  The ECFP process reflects Ethereum Classic’s commitment to decentralization, sovereignty, and trust minimization. It replaces opaque, foundation-based grantmaking with a public, rules-based system that any community member can engage with.

This ECIP ensures that the Olympia Treasury — funded via ECIP-1112 and governed via ECIP-1113 — has a robust and community-driven framework for advancing the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. The ECFP framework ensures Ethereum Classic evolves with the DAO-first ethos of modern decentralized ecosystems, bringing funding structure comparable to processes like Arbitrum’s AIP framework, Optimism’s RPGF, and Celo’s Community Fund. By defining a public, reproducible, and accountable pipeline for distributing protocol-level resources, the ECFP system empowers ETC to grow sustainably while preserving its founding principles of immutability, decentralization, and user sovereignty.


### Implementation

The ECFP process will be implemented as an integrated component of the Olympia DAO governance system (see ECIP-1113), which interfaces directly with the Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112). This process combines smart contract infrastructure with off-chain discussion forums and proposal documentation standards.

Key implementation elements include:

#### 1. Proposal Submission

- A dedicated ECFP submission portal SHALL be provided at `https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECFPs`.
- Proposals MUST include a valid ECFP number (assigned sequentially), title, rationale, funding amount, recipient address, and milestone schedule.
- Full-text proposals SHALL be stored using metadata pointers (e.g., IPFS CID or Arweave URL) to ensure permanence and auditability.
- Proposals SHOULD use the [ECFP Markdown template](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECFPs/blob/main/ecfp-template.md) to ensure consistency and ease of review.
- Off-chain proposal metadata MUST be stored in a content-addressable format (e.g., IPFS CID or Arweave URL) and referenced in the on-chain proposal via metadata hash or URL.
- Proposals MAY include links to mockups, prototypes, GitHub repos, or community endorsements as part of their metadata payload.

#### 2. On-Chain Registry and Voting

- The Olympia DAO smart contracts SHALL include a proposal registry that records submission timestamps, proposers, and vote outcomes.
- Governance contracts MUST enforce voting periods, quorum thresholds, and proposal execution conditions.
- Voter snapshots SHALL be recorded at the proposal block height to ensure fair participation and prevent manipulation.

#### 3. Execution and Disbursement

- Upon successful approval, the DAO contract SHALL call the `release()` or `execute()` function on the Olympia Treasury contract to disburse funds.
- Disbursements MAY be executed as:
  - One-time lump sum transfers,
  - Scheduled milestone-based vesting,
  - Or programmatic streams via contract-based disbursers.
- Execution MUST emit a standardized `ProposalExecuted` event from the DAO contract, including:
  - `ECFP ID`
  - Recipient address
  - Amount disbursed
  - Timestamp and block number
  - Executing proposal hash or reference
- All disbursements SHALL adhere to the execution rules defined in the Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112), which rejects any transfers not authorized by a successful on-chain proposal.
- The `execute()` or `release()` calls MUST include the associated `ECFP ID` and disbursement metadata in the transaction payload to ensure traceability and enforce auditability.

#### 4. Transparency Dashboard

- A public dashboard SHALL display proposal statuses, voting outcomes, treasury balances, and funding history.
- The dashboard SHALL be open source and mirror on-chain data for public verifiability.

#### 5. Community Review Layer

- Off-chain discussion SHALL take place on the ECIP forums, Discord, or approved governance platforms prior to on-chain voting.
- Moderators MAY facilitate proposal formatting and filtering but SHALL NOT possess approval or veto powers.

Initial testing and deployment will occur on the Mordor Testnet, followed by public audits and mainnet activation aligned with the rollout of ECIP-1112 and ECIP-1113.

### Backwards Compatibility

The ECFP process introduces a governance framework and funding workflow at the smart contract level. It does not modify Ethereum Classic’s consensus rules, transaction formats, or EVM behavior. As such, it is fully backward-compatible with existing contracts, wallets, clients, and applications.

Key points:

- Legacy smart contracts and dApps will remain unaffected.
- Participation in the ECFP process is voluntary; users, miners, and developers who do not engage with governance contracts are unaffected by its operation.
- The Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112) and Olympia DAO (ECIP-1113) must be deployed and supported by clients participating in governance to ensure execution compatibility.
- Node operators who choose not to upgrade to ECIP-1111–1114 will diverge from consensus, but application-layer compatibility remains intact.

Because the ECFP system operates entirely through standard smart contract interactions, its implementation poses no risk to prior state, core protocol behavior, or existing network functionality.

### Security Considerations

Although ECIP-1114 defines a **funding process** rather than consensus-level protocol logic, it introduces important security and integrity requirements. These are organized into five categories:

---

#### 1. Metadata and Proposal Integrity

- **Content-Addressed Metadata**:  
  Every ECFP MUST include a content hash (e.g., IPFS CID or Arweave digest) in its on-chain metadata to prevent tampering.

- **Immutable References**:  
  The off-chain proposal metadata MUST be content-addressed and stored immutably. Voters must be guaranteed that the referenced content cannot be modified after submission.

- **Proposal Uniqueness**:  
  Each ECFP ID MUST be globally unique and immutable to prevent collisions, replay attacks, or duplicate execution.

- **Replay Protection**:  
  All ECFPs MUST include a chain ID and governance domain separator in the payload to prevent replay on forks or testnets.

---

#### 2. Treasury and DAO Safeguards

- **DAO–Treasury Isolation**:  
  The Treasury contract does NOT parse or interpret proposals. It acts only on `release()` or `execute()` calls from the authorized DAO executor.

- **Restricted Permissions**:  
  Treasury execution functions MUST reject any unauthorized callers, including EOAs or unknown contracts.

- **No Arbitrary Execution**:  
  ECFPs CANNOT deploy custom logic or grant emergency authority. Execution is restricted to fixed, auditable disbursement logic as defined in ECIP-1112.

- **Immutable Lifecycle States**:  
  Once an ECFP enters the `Active` state (on-chain voting), it becomes immutable. No changes can be made after that point.

- **Redundant Event Logging**:  
  Both the DAO and Treasury SHOULD emit execution events (e.g., `ProposalExecuted`) to support auditability and transparency across explorers and indexers.

---

#### 3. Governance Process Risks

- **Governance Capture**:  
  A minority with concentrated voting power could dominate treasury flows. Mitigations include:
  - Quorum thresholds  
  - Delegated voting models  
  - Governance parameter audits and upgrade reviews

- **Replay Mitigation**:  
  Governance proposals MUST include a unique domain and ID to prevent cross-network replay.

- **DAO Upgrade Risks**:  
  If the DAO governance system is upgradable, upgrade paths MUST be:
  - Time-locked  
  - Audited  
  - Approved via public on-chain governance  

  This ensures that no upgrade can be rushed or executed unilaterally.

---

#### 4. Execution and Implementation Risks

- **Client Consistency**:  
  Clients MUST verify that only valid DAO-approved proposals can trigger treasury actions. Inconsistencies can cause consensus failures or fund loss.

- **Reentrancy and Logic Bugs**:  
  DAO and Treasury contracts MUST be formally verified and audited to avoid logic errors or reentrancy attacks.

- **Proposal Manipulation**:  
  Malicious ECFPs with deceptive deliverables or vague KPIs are possible. This is mitigated by:
  - Structured templates  
  - Review periods  
  - Mandatory metadata and outcome tracking

- **Funding Abuse**:  
  Approved proposals SHOULD use milestone-based disbursement, vesting schedules, and clawback clauses to ensure accountability.

---

#### 5. Spam Resistance and Participation Gating

- **Sybil Resistance**:  
  The DAO MAY enforce minimum participation gates to prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks, such as:
  - Token staking requirements  
  - Submission cooldown periods  
  - Reputation systems or contributor whitelists  

  These mechanisms MUST preserve the permissionless nature of the process and avoid overly burdensome barriers to entry.

---

#### Summary

ECIP-1114 introduces a structured and transparent funding pipeline via the ECFP format. To ensure long-term security and resilience:

- All metadata must be immutable and auditable.  
- Treasury disbursement is strictly controlled through DAO logic.  
- Governance and execution paths must be secured, rate-limited, and transparent.  
- Participation must remain open while defending against spam and manipulation.

Prior to mainnet deployment, the full ECFP system MUST undergo testnet trials, contract audits, and public peer review to validate these safeguards.
