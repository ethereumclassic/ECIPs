#### EIP Summaries and expected action
##### Included - Olympia
- EIP 1559 "Fee market change": An additional transaction type which includes a pricing mechanism that includes fixed-per-block base fee and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion.
  - The implementation of EIP-1559 in the London Upgrade made the transaction fee mechanism more complex, but made gas fees more predictable, resulting in a more efficient transaction fee market.
- EIP 3198 "BASEFEE opcode": Adds an opcode that gives the EVM access to the blockâ€™s base fee. 
  - The intended use case would be for contracts to get the value of the base fee of EIP-1559 transactions for gas estimatations

##### Omitted - London
- EIP 3228Â "ðŸ’£Â delay": Delays the difficulty bomb to show effect the first week of December 2021.
  - Not applicable to ETC due to difficulty bomb being defused 

##### Omitted - Shanghai
- EIP 4399 "Supplant DIFFICULTY opcode with PREVRANDAO": Historically, the DIFFICULTY (0X44) instruction was used as a source of pseudo randomness. With the switch to Proof of Stake, Ethereum removed the work difficulty so, as a replacement, they now expose a [RANDAO](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/block-proposal/#random-selection) value taken from the beacon chain. Since v0.8.18, Solidity [deprecates](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.18/cheatsheet.html#global-variables) `block.difficulty` and replaces it with `block.prevrandao` but this syntactic change still compiles to the same EVM opcode, i.e. `0x44`, which in the Ethereum Classic network will continue to evaluate as the aforementioned _block difficulty_ value.
- EIP 4895 "Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations": In Proof of Stake networks, enable validator withdrawals from the beacon chain to the EVM. Ethereum Classic network only grants rewards through Proof of Work mining on the canonical chain, there are no validators, so this doesn't apply.


This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes
in the Classic networks:

- `TBD` on Mordor Testnet PoW-testnet (TBD)
- `TBD` on Ethereum Classic Mainnet PoW-mainnet (TBD)

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and
implementations, please see the _Specification_ section of this document.

### Motivation

To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machineâ€™s (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes shall be added to the Ethereum Classic networks, all of which have been in use on the Ethereum Foundation networks since 2024.

### Specification

Technical specifications for each EIP can be found at those documents
respectively:

_London_
- [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198): BASEFEE opcode
- [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559): Fee market change
- [EIP-3228](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3228): ðŸ’£Â delay

_Shanghai_
- [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399): Supplant DIFFICULTY opcode with PREVRANDAO
- [EIP-4895](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895): Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations

### Rationale

__Interoperability__: Establishing and maintaining interoperable behavior
between Ethereum clients is essential for developers and end-user adoption,
yielding benefits for all participating chains (e.g., ETC and ETH, Mordor and Sepolia).

__Immutability__: None of the introduced new opcodes in the EVM has the
potential to change the behavior of existing contracts; in the case where
previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode would have been deployed to the
network, none of them would be able to modify the state of the Ethereum Classic
networks retrospectively. Adding opcodes to the EVM increases its functionality
and should be considered a feature upgrade rather than a modification.

__Standards Compliance__: In order to guarantee compatibility with the greter EVM standard, we need to support valid evm transactions types so the application layer can support modern web3 dapps. 

### Implementation

Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces
changes that are not backward compatible.

The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the _London_
features currently and will be able to support the _Olympia_ upgrade:

- Core-Geth (maintained by ETC Coopertive)
