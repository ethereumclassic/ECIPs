### Simple Summary

This proposal activates select Ethereum protocol upgrades on Ethereum Classic via a hard fork named Olympia. Specifically, it introduces EIP-1559 and EIP-3198 to enhance Ethereum Classic’s EVM compatibility, improve gas pricing, and redirect the `BASEFEE` to a decentralized, permissionless on-chain treasury (ECIP-1112), governed by Olympia DAO (ECIP-1113), for sustainable development funding. The goal is to enhance interoperability with the broader Ethereum ecosystem while preserving Ethereum Classic's Proof-of-Work consensus and core principles.

### Abstract

This ECIP proposes the activation of selected Ethereum protocol upgrades on the Ethereum Classic network under the hard fork name Olympia. The upgrade includes EIP-1559, which introduces a dynamic base fee mechanism to improve transaction fee predictability and market efficiency, and EIP-3198, which adds the BASEFEE opcode for EVM compatibility. These changes are intended to enhance interoperability with Ethereum and other EVM-based networks while preserving Ethereum Classic’s Proof-of-Work consensus and immutability principles. The Olympia Treasury (see ECIP-1112) receives all `BASEFEE` revenue, which is governed on-chain by Olympia DAO (ECIP-1113) through the Ethereum Classic Funding Proposal process (ECIP-1114), and executed off-chain by Ethereum Classic DAO LLC as a legal interface for compliance, payments, and treasury administration.

The proposal excludes upgrades tied to Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake or those irrelevant to Ethereum Classic’s architecture, such as validator withdrawal operations and randomness derived from the beacon chain. Implementation requires coordination across client software and network participants for a scheduled hard fork at block heights to be determined on Mordor Testnet and Ethereum Classic Mainnet.

### EIP Summaries and Expected Action

#### Included in Olympia Upgrade

- **EIP-1559 – Fee Market Change**
Introduces a new transaction type with a dynamically adjusting base fee per gas and an optional priority tip to incentivize miners. On Ethereum Classic, instead of being burned (as on Ethereum Mainnet), the `BASEFEE` is retained and redirected to the **Olympia Treasury**, an open on-chain development fund. This design aligns incentives between developers, miners, and users by converting transaction demand into sustainable network funding. As ETC's block reward continues to decline under [ECIP-1017](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1017) monetary policy, this mechanism ensures the network retains a long-term **security and development budget** tied directly to economic activity on-chain.

- **EIP-3198 – BASEFEE Opcode**
Adds a new opcode that allows smart contracts to access the current block’s basefee, as defined by EIP-1559. This enables more accurate on-chain gas estimation and supports modern fee-aware applications.

This ECIP proposes the activation of these changes at the following block heights:

<!-- Block heights to be determined after testnet validation and client release coordination -->

- Mordor Testnet: `TBD`

- Ethereum Classic Mainnet: `TBD`

For full technical specifications, see the Specification section below.

### Motivation

The Olympia upgrade seeks to advance Ethereum Classic’s protocol capabilities by adopting proven Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enhancements introduced by the Ethereum Foundation. By implementing EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, Ethereum Classic will gain compatibility with modern transaction formats and smart contract expectations used across the broader EVM ecosystem.

These changes provide four core benefits to the Ethereum Classic ecosystem:

1. **EVM Compatibility** – Developers can deploy EVM-standard dApps on Ethereum Classic without modification or workarounds, reducing friction and enabling seamless cross-chain application deployment.

2. **Fee Market Modernization** – EIP-1559 introduces a more predictable and user-friendly gas pricing mechanism, aligning ETC with fee market improvements already adopted by major EVM chains.

3. **Network Utility and Adoption** – Aligning with the broader EVM roadmap ensures Ethereum Classic remains relevant for developers, tooling providers, infrastructure teams, and users seeking a Proof-of-Work alternative to Ethereum.

4. **Sustainable Development Incentives** – Redirecting the `BASEFEE` to the Olympia Treasury enables Ethereum Classic to fund open-source development and long-term protocol maintenance without inflating supply. This ensures that, as block rewards decline under ECIP-1017, the network retains a credible on-chain security and innovation budget. This structure not only replaces centralized or discretionary funding models but also formalizes the relationship between protocol revenue and ecosystem development.

### Specification

The Olympia upgrade activates the following EIPs on the Ethereum Classic network. Technical specifications and implementation details are defined in the canonical EIP documentation:

#### Included from London Hard Fork

[EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) – Fee Market Change  
Introduces a new transaction type with a dynamic `basefee`, redirected per block to the Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112), while miner tips remain payable to block producers.

[EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198) – BASEFEE Opcode
Adds the BASEFEE opcode (0x48) to the EVM, allowing smart contracts to query the current block’s base fee.

On Ethereum Classic, the `BASEFEE` is not burned but redirected to a dedicated, non-upgradable smart contract known as the **Olympia Treasury** (see ECIP-1112). This contract accumulates protocol-level fee revenue to fund ecosystem development and security, and is governed transparently via on-chain processes.

No additional changes beyond these EIPs are included in the Olympia upgrade. Clients should adhere strictly to the behavior defined in the linked specifications.

### Rationale

__Interoperability__: Maintaining interoperability with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains is essential to ensuring developer portability, tooling support, and infrastructure reuse. By aligning with key protocol features like EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, Ethereum Classic reduces fragmentation and remains a viable deployment target for modern EVM applications and clients (e.g., ETC ↔ ETH parity). 

__Immutability__: The proposed upgrades introduce new transaction types and opcodes but do not alter the semantics of existing contracts or state. Historical contracts will behave identically, and no prior behavior is retroactively affected. These are strictly additive changes to EVM functionality and maintain the network’s commitment to immutability.

__Standards Compliance__: Supporting canonical EIPs is critical for application-layer compatibility. Without EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, Ethereum Classic would lack support for transaction types and opcodes widely expected by wallets, bridges, rollups, and contract compilers. Adopting these standards helps ensure that modern Web3 applications can be deployed on ETC without modification.

### Real-World Precedents for BASEFEE Redirection

While Ethereum Mainnet burns the `BASEFEE` under EIP-1559, a small number of EVM-compatible networks have chosen to redirect this fee to protocol treasuries instead. For example, the **Ronin** sidechain (Axie Infinity) routes base fee revenue to its [Ronin Treasury contract](https://explorer.roninchain.com/address/0x9f76b782bdfba7a5e9eaa9b7b0f2c78b6596b217), while **Celo** (a Proof-of-Stake L1) directs base fees to a [Gas Fee Handler contract](https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438) governed by its DAO. These implementations demonstrate that treating `BASEFEE` as protocol income — rather than as a deflationary burn — is a viable and increasingly adopted alternative. By doing so, Ethereum Classic aligns with a growing trend toward using network activity to fund decentralized development in a sustainable, transparent, and incentive-aligned manner.

Other networks such as **Mantle** and **Polygon CDK** also incorporate protocol revenue flows into DAO treasuries through modular treasury contracts. While not all use the `BASEFEE` directly, these implementations support the broader design of EVM-aligned, treasury-governed ecosystems.

### Modular Activation

While ECIP-1111 introduces BASEFEE redirection to an on-chain treasury, it does not require immediate deployment or activation of the Olympia DAO (ECIP-1113) or the legal interface (ECIP-1114). The BASEFEE is redirected to a passive, immutable treasury contract defined in ECIP-1112, which can safely accumulate funds until additional governance layers are deployed.

This modular design ensures ECIP-1111 can be activated independently. Ethereum Classic nodes and users benefit from improved EVM compatibility and a fee market without being dependent on downstream DAO readiness. Funds will remain securely held and auditable in the treasury until governance proposals are enabled at a later stage.

### Implementation

Adopting the Olympia upgrade requires a coordinated hard fork, as it introduces non-backward-compatible changes to the Ethereum Classic protocol and transaction format. Clients must implement support for the EIP-1559 fee market and the EIP-3198 `BASEFEE` opcode.

The following client currently maintains compatibility with the Ethereum Classic network and supports the necessary features introduced in Ethereum’s London upgrade:

- [Core-Geth](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth) – Maintained by the Ethereum Classic community, Core-Geth includes a stable implementation of EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, and will be the primary reference client for the Olympia fork.

Client implementers must ensure correct behavior as defined in the relevant EIPs and coordinate activation on both Mordor Testnet and Ethereum Classic Mainnet at the block heights defined in this ECIP.

Testing should include full validation of:

- Legacy and EIP-1559 transaction types

- Gas accounting for basefee burn and miner tips

- `BASEFEE` opcode availability and correct return values

- Cross-version transaction replay protection

Community coordination is required to finalize testnet and mainnet fork block numbers, along with updated client releases that embed the Olympia fork rules.

Implementation of the Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112) and Olympia DAO governance (ECIP-1113) — including its legal interface via ECIP-1114 — are defined separately. This ECIP strictly introduces the on-chain redirection mechanism and EVM upgrades. This ECIP solely introduces the protocol-level redirection logic and opcode activation.

### Reference Implementation

- Reference client: [Core-Geth](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth)
- EIP-1559 and EIP-3198 are implemented in Core-Geth under the `olympia-upgrade` branch, which also includes basefee redirection to the treasury contract as per ECIP-1112.
- Testnet deployment and validation will occur on Mordor prior to mainnet activation.


### EIP Compatibility Scope

The Olympia upgrade is purposefully limited in scope. It includes only the two EIPs relevant to fee market modernization and EVM compatibility (EIP-1559 and EIP-3198).

All other Ethereum Foundation EIPs—from Tangerine Whistle (2016) to Prague-Electra (2025)—were reviewed and explicitly omitted due to one or more of the following:

- Dependence on Proof-of-Stake consensus
- Incompatibility with ETC's Proof-of-Work architecture
- Lack of developer or user demand
- Risk of breaking immutability or changing contract behavior

### Backwards Compatibility

The Olympia upgrade introduces a new transaction type (Type-2) and an additional EVM opcode (`BASEFEE`). Legacy Type-0 transactions and all previously deployed contracts will remain valid and operate as before. However, nodes that do not upgrade will become incompatible and fork from the canonical Ethereum Classic chain upon activation. This upgrade does not retroactively alter historical blocks and maintains full execution compatibility with existing smart contracts. All new behavior is opt-in based on transaction type and client version.


### Security Considerations

The Olympia Upgrade introduces no new consensus-critical vulnerabilities beyond the adoption of EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, both of which are well-established across the EVM ecosystem. Key considerations are outlined below:

---

#### 1. EIP-1559 Safety and Maturity

- **Production Provenance**:  
  The `BASEFEE` opcode and EIP-1559 transaction format have been widely deployed and audited across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and OP Stack networks.

- **Consensus Confidence**:  
  These features have undergone extensive production testing, formal verification, and consensus testing since their activation on Ethereum Mainnet.

---

#### 2. BASEFEE Redirection Logic

- **Redirect Scope**:  
  The only deviation from Ethereum’s implementation is the redirection of `BASEFEE` to the Olympia Treasury instead of burning it.

- **Protocol Enforcement**:  
  This redirection is **hardcoded at the consensus level**. EOAs and contracts cannot modify or reroute this behavior.

- **No Impact to Opcode Set or Gas Accounting**:  
  The Olympia Upgrade does **not modify** the EVM opcode set, gas mechanics, or transaction processing outside of what is already defined in EIP-1559 and EIP-3198.

---

#### 3. Client Implementation Requirements

- **State Integrity**:  
  Core-Geth and other clients must ensure that the `BASEFEE` redirect does not introduce:
  - Rounding errors  
  - State inconsistencies  
  - Incorrect accounting of cumulative gas usage

- **Reference Test Vector Updates**:  
  Ethereum Mainnet test vectors (which expect `BASEFEE` to be burned) MUST be adjusted to validate accumulation in the treasury address.

- **Cross-Client Compatibility**:  
  All clients participating in the Olympia Upgrade must implement the redirect logic identically to avoid consensus divergence.

---

#### 4. Treasury and DAO Isolation

- **Smart Contract Safety**:  
  While ECIP-1111 does not introduce smart contracts itself, it **enables treasury accumulation** via BASEFEE.  
  The treasury contract and governance systems (defined in ECIPs 1112–1114) include **separate security constraints** and **cannot influence base protocol behavior**.

- **Withdrawal Safety**:  
  Treasury funds cannot be moved without successful, on-chain governance execution through the Olympia DAO.  
  This separation ensures that protocol-level fee logic is isolated from governance risk.

---

#### 5. Testing and Audit Strategy

- **Hardcoded Redirect Validation**:  
  Implementers must verify BASEFEE redirection through testnet simulation and consensus checks.

- **Mordor Testnet Deployment**:  
  Prior to mainnet activation, full testing will be conducted on the Mordor Testnet, including:
  - EIP-1559 transaction validation  
  - BASEFEE accumulation in the treasury  
  - Invariant checks on state transition correctness

- **Audit Alignment**:  
  Although ECIP-1111 activates only protocol-level features, client teams are encouraged to coordinate audits in parallel with ECIP-1112–1114 to ensure full-stack integrity.

---

#### Summary

The Olympia Upgrade builds upon proven EVM features (EIP-1559, EIP-3198) and introduces a hardcoded, consensus-level redirect of the `BASEFEE` to a transparent treasury. No additional opcodes or gas mechanics are introduced. All treasury management logic is deferred to audited smart contracts governed by the Olympia DAO, preserving protocol security while enabling sustainable ecosystem funding.

## Appendix: EVM Compatibility Roadmap and Upgrade Candidates

### Future Considerations: Toward Full EVM Compatibility

While the Olympia Upgrade is intentionally limited in scope to EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, a review of additional Ethereum protocol improvements was conducted to identify candidates for future adoption. The table below categorizes EIPs from Ethereum’s post-London upgrade path based on their compatibility with Ethereum Classic’s Proof-of-Work model, utility to developers, and alignment with ETC’s values of immutability, security, and simplicity.

This matrix serves as a foundation for community discussion and potential inclusion in future hard forks.

> 📘 Note: The EIPs listed below are not part of the current Olympia Upgrade activation but may be included in a subsequent ECIP following community consensus and testnet validation.


### ✅ Candidates for Future Inclusion

These EIPs are not included in ECIP-1111 but are technically and philosophically compatible with Ethereum Classic’s Proof-of-Work model. Their future inclusion would follow the ECIP-1000 process and require consensus among core developers, miners, and ecosystem stakeholders.

### ⚠️ Optional / Low Priority

| EIP   | Title                        | Notes                                                                                     |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 170   | Contract Code Size Limit     | Useful for DoS mitigation, but ETC hasn’t encountered this issue. Optional safeguard.     |
| 3228  | Difficulty Bomb Delay        | Only relevant to Ethereum’s PoS transition. No action needed.                             |
| 7691  | Blob Throughput Increase     | Applies only to networks implementing EIP-4844. ETC does not currently support blobs.     |
| 7702  | Set EOA Account Code         | Supports future account abstraction. Not urgent unless ETC pursues this roadmap.          |

### ❌ Should Remain Omitted (PoS-Specific or Incompatible)

| EIP(s)                                            | Reason to Remain Excluded                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3675, 4895, 4788, 4399, 6110, 7251, 7549, 7002, 7685, 7840 | All relate to Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake, beacon chain, validator operations, or staking exit logic — incompatible with ETC's PoW consensus. |
| 4844, 7516                                       | Depend on blob transaction infrastructure and consensus changes. High complexity with minimal benefit unless ETC plans major infra upgrades. |
| 2537                                            | Introduces BLS12-381 precompile. Adds cryptographic surface area for PoS use cases; not currently useful for ETC.                       |
