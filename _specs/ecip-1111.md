### Simple Summary

This proposal activates select Ethereum protocol upgrades on Ethereum Classic via a hard fork named Olympia. Specifically, it introduces EIP-1559 and EIP-3198 to enhance Ethereum Classic’s EVM compatibility, improve gas pricing, and redirect the basefee to an open, decentralized, and permissionless on-chain treasury for sustainable development funding. The goal is to enhance interoperability with the broader Ethereum ecosystem while preserving Ethereum Classic's Proof-of-Work consensus and core principles.

### Abstract

This ECIP proposes the activation of selected Ethereum protocol upgrades on the Ethereum Classic network under the hard fork name Olympia. The upgrade includes EIP-1559, which introduces a dynamic base fee mechanism to improve transaction fee predictability and market efficiency, and EIP-3198, which adds the BASEFEE opcode for EVM compatibility. These changes are intended to enhance interoperability with Ethereum and other EVM-based networks while preserving Ethereum Classic’s Proof-of-Work consensus and immutability principles.

The proposal excludes upgrades tied to Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake or those irrelevant to Ethereum Classic’s architecture, such as validator withdrawal operations and randomness derived from the beacon chain. Implementation requires coordination across client software and network participants for a scheduled hard fork at block heights to be determined on Mordor Testnet and Ethereum Classic Mainnet.

### EIP Summaries and Expected Action

#### Included in Olympia Upgrade

- **EIP-1559 – Fee Market Change**
Introduces a new transaction type with a dynamically adjusting base fee per gas and an optional priority tip to incentivize miners. On Ethereum Classic, instead of being burned, the `basefee` is redirected to the **Olympia Treasury**, an open on-chain development fund. This design aligns incentives between developers, miners, and users by converting transaction demand into sustainable network funding. As ETC's block reward continues to decline under ECIP-1017 monetary policy, this mechanism ensures the network retains a long-term **security and development budget** tied directly to economic activity on-chain.

- **EIP-3198 – BASEFEE Opcode**
Adds a new opcode that allows smart contracts to access the current block’s basefee, as defined by EIP-1559. This enables more accurate on-chain gas estimation and supports modern fee-aware applications.

This ECIP proposes the activation of these changes at the following block heights:

<!-- Block heights to be determined after testnet validation and client release coordination -->

- Mordor Testnet: `TBD`

- Ethereum Classic Mainnet: `TBD`

For full technical specifications, see the Specification section below.

### Motivation

The Olympia upgrade seeks to advance Ethereum Classic’s protocol capabilities by adopting proven Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enhancements introduced by the Ethereum Foundation. By implementing EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, Ethereum Classic will gain compatibility with modern transaction formats and smart contract expectations used across the broader EVM ecosystem.

These changes provide four core benefits:

1. **EVM Compatibility** – Developers can deploy EVM-standard dApps on Ethereum Classic without modification or workarounds, reducing friction and encouraging cross-chain application portability.

2. **Fee Market Modernization** – EIP-1559 introduces a predictable and more user-friendly gas pricing mechanism, aligning ETC with fee market improvements already adopted by major EVM chains.

3. **Network Utility and Adoption** – Aligning with the broader EVM roadmap ensures Ethereum Classic remains relevant for developers, tooling providers, infrastructure teams, and users seeking a Proof-of-Work alternative to Ethereum.

4. **Sustainable Development Incentives** – Redirecting the `basefee` to the Olympia Treasury enables Ethereum Classic to fund open-source development and long-term protocol maintenance without inflating supply. This ensures that, as block rewards decline under ECIP-1017, the network retains a credible on-chain security and innovation budget.

### Specification

The Olympia upgrade activates the following EIPs on the Ethereum Classic network. Technical specifications and implementation details are defined in the canonical EIP documentation:

#### Included from London Hard Fork

[EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) – Fee Market Change  
Introduces a new transaction type with a dynamic `basefee`, redirected per block to the Olympia Treasury, and an optional miner tip.

[EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198) – BASEFEE Opcode
Adds the BASEFEE opcode (0x48) to the EVM, allowing smart contracts to query the current block’s base fee.

On Ethereum Classic, the `basefee` is not burned but redirected to a dedicated smart contract known as the **Olympia Treasury**. This contract accumulates protocol-level fee revenue to fund ecosystem development and security, and is governed transparently via on-chain processes.

No additional changes beyond these EIPs are included in the Olympia upgrade. Clients should adhere strictly to the behavior defined in the linked specifications.

### Rationale

__Interoperability__: Maintaining interoperability with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains is essential to ensuring developer portability, tooling support, and infrastructure reuse. By aligning with key protocol features like EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, Ethereum Classic reduces fragmentation and remains a viable deployment target for modern EVM applications and clients (e.g., ETC ↔ ETH parity).

__Immutability__: The proposed upgrades introduce new transaction types and opcodes but do not alter the semantics of existing contracts or state. Historical contracts will behave identically, and no prior behavior is retroactively affected. These are strictly additive changes to EVM functionality and maintain the network’s commitment to immutability.

__Standards Compliance__: Supporting canonical EIPs is critical for application-layer compatibility. Without EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, Ethereum Classic would lack support for transaction types and opcodes widely expected by wallets, bridges, rollups, and contract compilers. Adopting these standards helps ensure that modern Web3 applications can be deployed on ETC without modification.

### Implementation

Adopting the Olympia upgrade requires a coordinated hard fork, as it introduces non-backward-compatible changes to the Ethereum Classic protocol and transaction format. Clients must implement support for the EIP-1559 fee market and the EIP-3198 `BASEFEE` opcode.

The following client currently maintains compatibility with the Ethereum Classic network and supports the necessary features introduced in Ethereum’s London upgrade:

- [Core-Geth](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth) – Maintained by the Ethereum Classic community, Core-Geth includes a stable implementation of EIP-1559 and EIP-3198, and will be the primary reference client for the Olympia fork.

Client implementers must ensure correct behavior as defined in the relevant EIPs and coordinate activation on both Mordor Testnet and Ethereum Classic Mainnet at the block heights defined in this ECIP.

Testing should include full validation of:

- Legacy and EIP-1559 transaction types

- Gas accounting for basefee burn and miner tips

- `BASEFEE` opcode availability and correct return values

- Cross-version transaction replay protection

Community coordination is required to finalize testnet and mainnet fork block numbers, along with updated client releases that embed the Olympia fork rules.

### Reference Implementation

- Reference client: [Core-Geth](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth)
- EIP-1559 and EIP-3198 are already implemented in Core-Geth (see `olympia-upgrade` branch).
- Testnet deployment and validation will occur on Mordor prior to mainnet activation.


### EIP Compatibility Scope

The Olympia upgrade is purposefully limited in scope. It includes only the two EIPs relevant to fee market modernization and EVM compatibility (EIP-1559 and EIP-3198).

All other Ethereum Foundation EIPs—from Tangerine Whistle (2016) to Prague-Electra (2025)—were reviewed and explicitly omitted due to one or more of the following:

- Dependence on Proof-of-Stake consensus
- Incompatibility with ETC's Proof-of-Work architecture
- Lack of developer or user demand
- Risk of breaking immutability or changing contract behavior

### Backwards Compatibility

The Olympia upgrade introduces a new transaction type (Type-2) and an additional EVM opcode (`BASEFEE`). Legacy Type-0 transactions and all previously deployed contracts will remain valid and operate as before. However, nodes that do not upgrade will become incompatible and fork from the canonical Ethereum Classic chain upon activation.


### Security Considerations

No new consensus-critical vulnerabilities are introduced by this upgrade. The `BASEFEE` opcode and EIP-1559 transaction format have been widely adopted and audited across the EVM ecosystem. Core-Geth implementers are advised to validate integration against existing test vectors and consensus tests.
