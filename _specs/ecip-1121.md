ecip: 1121
title: Execution Client Specification Alignment (Olympia Hardfork)

## Abstract

ECIP-1121 documents the Ethereum execution-layer protocol specifications that Ethereum Classic execution clients implement in order to remain execution-client parallel with Ethereum, excluding fee-market governance and blob-based data availability mechanics.

This ECIP serves as the execution-layer bookend for the Olympia ECIP option set (ECIP-1111, ECIP-1112, ECIP-1113, ECIP-1114, ECIP-1115, ECIP-1116, ECIP-1117, ECIP-1118, ECIP-1119 and ECIP-1120), consolidating execution semantics that are independent of consensus, treasury policy, or data-availability design choices.

This ECIP is informational and does not introduce new protocol changes.
This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Ethereum Classic networks:

TBD on Mordor testnet
TBD on Ethereum Classic mainnet

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the Specification section of this document.

## Motivation

Ethereum Classic has historically adopted a conservative, explicitly documented approach to protocol upgrades, as demonstrated in the Spiral and Mystique hard forks. Execution-layer compatibility with Ethereum improves tooling interoperability, client robustness, and auditability, while preserving Ethereum Classic’s Proof-of-Work consensus and economic neutrality.

Since Spiral and Mystique, and continuing through Ethereum’s Fusaka execution-layer upgrades, a set of execution client specifications has emerged that:

- Do not depend on Proof-of-Stake
- Do not mandate blob data availability
- Do not alter Ethereum Classic’s monetary or treasury policy

These execution semantics are already implemented or are directly implementable in Ethereum Classic execution clients. ECIP-1121 consolidates them into a single reference document.

---

## Scope

This ECIP:

- Applies to execution-layer behavior only
- Excludes fee market governance defined in the Olympia ECIP set
- Explicitly defers blob data availability mechanics
- Does not modify consensus rules
- Does not define activation blocks (TBD)

## Rationale

Separating execution-layer semantics from economic and governance policy:

- Preserves Ethereum Classic’s Proof-of-Work integrity
- Improves client and tooling interoperability
- Reduces governance coupling
- Mirrors the successful structure of Spiral and Mystique ECIPs

---

## Backwards Compatibility

This ECIP introduces no new protocol changes and does not affect backwards compatibility.

---

## Security Considerations

Clear documentation of execution-layer behavior improves auditability and reduces the risk of divergent client implementations or incorrect application assumptions.
