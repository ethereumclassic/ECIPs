### Simple Summary

Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation _Istanbul_ network protocol upgrades on the Ethereum
Classic network in a hard-fork code-named _Asgard_ to enable maximum compatibility across these networks.

### Abstract

Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the
_Istanbul_ hardforks. The proposed changes for Ethereum Classic's _Asgard_ upgrade include:

- TBD

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:

- `TBD` on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet (TBD 2020)
- `TBD` on Morden Classic PoW-testnet (TBD 2020)
- `TBD` on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet (TBD 2020)

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the _Specification_
section of this document.

### Motivation

To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes shall be added to the Ethereum Classic
networks, all of which have been in use on the Ethereum Foundation networks since late 2019.

### Specification

Technical specifications for each EIP can be found at those documents respectively:

- TBD

### Rationale

__Interoperability__: Establishing and maintaining interoperable behavior between Ethereum clients is essential for
developers and end-user adoption, yielding benefits for all participating chains (e.g., ETH and ETC, Ropsten and Morden,
GÃ¶rli and Kotti).

__Immutability__: None of the introduced new opcodes in the EVM has the potential to change the behavior of existing
contracts; in the case where previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode would have been deployed to the network, none of
them would be able to modify the state of the Ethereum Classic networks retrospectively. Adding opcodes to the EVM
increases its functionality and should be considered a feature upgrade rather than a modification.

### Implementation

Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible.

The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the _Istanbul_ features currently:

- TBD
