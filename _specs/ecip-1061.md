### Simple Summary

Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation _Istanbul_ network protocol upgrades on the Ethereum
Classic network in a hard-fork code-named _Aztlán_ to enable maximum compatibility across these networks.

### Abstract

Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the
_Istanbul_ hardforks.

There are four alterative proposals with varying levels of backwards and
forwards compatibility for the _Aztlán_ upgrade:

- [ECIP-1072](https://ecips.ethereum.org/ECIPS/ecip-1072) - Yuanchun Edition
- [ECIP-1073](https://ecips.ethereum.org/ECIPS/ecip-1073) - Xichun Edition
- [ECIP-1074](https://ecips.ethereum.org/ECIPS/ecip-1074) - Tanchun Edition
- [ECIP-1075](https://ecips.ethereum.org/ECIPS/ecip-1075) - Basic Edition

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:

- `TBD` on Mordor Classic PoW-testnet (Feb 5th, 2020)
- `TBD` on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet (Feb 12th, 2020)
- `TBD` on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet (March 25th, 2020)

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the _Specification_
section of this document.

### Final Note

- Users of the Geth Classic client are urged to migrate their services to Parity Ethereum, Multi-Geth, or Hyperledger Besu. It is no longer recommended to run Geth Classic in production.
- Users of the Morden Classic testnet are urged to migrate their applications to the Kotti Classic or Morder Classic testnets.
