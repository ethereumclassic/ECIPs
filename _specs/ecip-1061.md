### Simple Summary

Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation _Istanbul_ network protocol upgrades on the Ethereum
Classic network without any gas-cost assumptions in a hard-fork code-named _Aztlán (Yingchun Edition)_ to enable 
maximum compatibility across these networks. 

The _Yingchun_ Edition refers to the preferred variant of _Aztlán_ without any repricing of state-trie 
dependent opcodes as previously proposed in [ECIP-1072](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1072).

### Abstract

Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the
_Istanbul_ hardforks. The proposed changes for Ethereum Classic's _Aztlán_ upgrade include:

- Add Blake2 compression function `F` precompile
- Reduce alt_bn128 precompile gas costs
- Add ChainID opcode
- Calldata gas cost reduction
- Rebalance net-metered SSTORE gas cost with consideration of SLOAD gas cost change

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:

- `778_507` on Mordor Classic PoW-testnet (activated on Jan 30th, 2020)
- `2_058_191` on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet (approx Feb 12th, 2020)
- `10_500_839` on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet (approx Jun 10th, 2020)

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the _Specification_
section of this document.

### Motivation

To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes shall be added to the Ethereum Classic
networks, all of which have been in use on the Ethereum Foundation networks since end of 2019.

### Specification

Technical specifications for each EIP can be found at those documents respectively:

- [EIP-152](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-152): Add Blake2 compression function `F` precompile
- [EIP-1108](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1108): Reduce alt_bn128 precompile gas costs
- [EIP-1344](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1344): Add ChainID opcode
- [EIP-2028](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028): Calldata gas cost reduction
- [EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200): Rebalance net-metered SSTORE gas cost with consideration of SLOAD gas cost change

### Rationale

__Interoperability__: Establishing and maintaining interoperable behavior between Ethereum clients is essential for
developers and end-user adoption, yielding benefits for all participating chains (e.g., ETH and ETC, Ropsten and Mordor,
Görli and Kotti).

__Immutability__: None of the introduced new opcodes in the EVM has the potential to change the behavior of existing
contracts; in the case where previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode would have been deployed to the network, none of
them would be able to modify the state of the Ethereum Classic networks retrospectively. Adding opcodes to the EVM
increases its functionality and should be considered a feature upgrade rather than a modification. In particular, a delay
of Istanbul's EIP-1884 activation should be considered until backward-compatibility solutions are in place on Ethereum Classic.

### Implementation

Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible.

The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the _Istanbul_ features currently:

- Parity Ethereum
- Multi-Geth
- Hyperledger Besu

### Final Note

Both, the Geth Classic client and the Morden testnet will no longer be supported by the community and not recieve the _Aztlán_ ugrades.

- Users of the Geth Classic client are urged to migrate their services to Parity Ethereum, Multi-Geth, or Hyperledger Besu. It is no longer recommended to run Geth Classic in production.
- Users of the Morden Classic testnet are urged to migrate their applications to the Kotti Classic or Morder Classic testnets.
