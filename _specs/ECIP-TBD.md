### Proposal

I propose Wei Tang (@sorpaas) be expelled from the Ethereum Classic organization as a 'member' or 'owner' whatever is his role there. I also propose for him to be taken out as an 'editor' in the ECIP process, namely ECIP-1000, and that ECIP-1000 be replaced with a new clean 'process' ECIP with a new author, so Sorpaas is removed from that position as well.

### Rationale

1. He doxxed two editors in ECIP-1000 and fails to correct that doxxing even after being called out for it.
2. Abuses his position as ECIP 'editor' and ECIP-1000 'author' to impose false process rules and procedures that only advance his ideas and agenda.
3. He constantly lies about how the ECIP process 'should' be according to imaginary rules he makes up, just to stop others from opining and introducing their ideas.
4. He is persistently abusive and bully to other developers and contributors by threatening and telling them they 'want bugs' on ETC and that they promote a new 'theDAO'.
5. He falsely creates an equivalency between the operating blockchain and the ECIP process as if the ECIP process were as sacred as the blockchain, and property and agreements within it.

### Motivation

In general, Sorpaas has become a very negative participant, is inhibiting others from freely participating in the development process, and abuses his quadruple position as a client developer, ETC Github member, ECIP editor, and ECIP-1000 author.

For the above I make this proposal for his removal from all those positions in the ETC ecosystem.

### Implementation

When this ECIP is accepted by rough consensus, the modifications proposed could be implemented by Ethereum Classic Organization owners on Github and ECIP editors directly on the corresponding ECIPs.
