### Proposal

I propose Wei Tang (@sorpaas) to be removed as 'editor' in the ECIP process: ECIP-1000.

### Rationale

1. He doxxed two editors in ECIP-1000 and fails to correct that doxxing even after being called out for it.
2. Abuses his position as ECIP 'editor' and ECIP-1000 'author' to impose false process rules and procedures that only advance his ideas and agenda.
3. He constantly lies about how the ECIP process 'should' be according to imaginary rules he makes up, just to stop others from opining and introducing their ideas.
4. He is persistently abusive and bully to other developers and contributors by threatening and telling them they 'want bugs' on ETC and that they promote a new 'theDAO'.
5. He falsely creates an equivalency between the operating blockchain and the ECIP process as if the ECIP process were as sacred as the blockchain, and property and agreements within it.

### Motivation

In general, Sorpaas has become a very negative participant, is inhibiting others from freely participating in the development process, and abuses his quadruple position as a client developer, ETC Github member, ECIP editor, and ECIP-1000 author.

For the above I make this proposal for his removal as ECIP-1000 editor.

### Implementation

When this ECIP is accepted by rough consensus, the modifications proposed could be implemented by Ethereum Classic Organization owners on Github and ECIP editors directly on the corresponding ECIPs.

### Some Evidence That Informs This Proposal

A. Sorpaas doxxing of two editors in ECIP-1000:

[You can see the ECIP-1000 document where two editors are doxxed (this will not be visible once it is corrected).](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1000)

B. Example of lying claiming that an 'accepted' ECIP cannot be changed:

C. Example of accusing other contributors of "bypassing" an imaginary rule in the process, and ECIP process as a whole, contributors just propose ideas:

D. Example of intimidation of other contributors accusing them of proposing things that will provoke vulnerabilities:

E. Example of making the false equivalence between the ECIP process and the operating blockchain, and intimidating other contributors by re-phrasing their comments, falsely claiming they mean something they don't and subsequently asking the contributor to shut up if he doesn't want his comments to be re-interpreted with false assumptions:

F. Lying about rules and text on ECIP-1000 that don't exist, trying to stop changes to his or other ECIPs:

![G](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29529586/72754356-c8466580-3b84-11ea-9b02-609f1b12414b.png)

G. Pointing again that a rule or text exists, but was never able to demonstrate because they don't actually exist. Subsequently, insulting the other contributor again:

![H](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29529586/72754495-3559fb00-3b85-11ea-9b44-9c59008dfb59.png)

I. Repeatedly falsely claiming other contributors don't want to follow or want to bypass the ECIP process as way to intimidate, change the conversation, and stop other changes making up reasons. 

Claiming that an "irregular" path is created, making the false analogy to theDAO hard fork "irregular state" transition:

![I](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29529586/72754762-fb3d2900-3b85-11ea-92ba-297956990eb6.png)
 
There is much more evidence from past conversations with others in the recent months.

**EDIT 01-21-2020:** Additional evidence of Sorpaas abuse of his position in his recent action: He vandalized this ECIP candidate by posting all the ECIPs he has written in the history of ETC as deleted, so they would be deleted when this ECIP were approved. This is a clear attempt to block his removal by using malicious tactics, rather than arguing in his favor.
