## Abstract

Turn off the artificial finality mechanism MESS (Modified Exponential Scoring) in Core-Geth (https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth) for Ethereum Classic.

## Motivation

MESS was designed as a peripheral patch on the incumbent GHOST-based chain arbitration algorithm. It was intended to mitigate the risk imparted to the chain by an adjacent chain -- the Ethereum mainnet -- which, while using its original PoW algorithm, dwarfed ETC's hashrate and thus established the vulnerable position MESS hoped to safeguard. ETH has now, since April of this year, moved from PoW to PoS, and its exit from the PoW economy has left ETC as the largest sink of compatible hashrate (limited by DAG and the hash type demand).

## Specification

MESS will be disabled by default in Core-Geth vX.Y.Z. 

An override flag for this decision will be provided to re-establish its normal operation. 

Users will be encouraged to upgrade or disable MESS manually (which can be done with all versions of core-geth having MESS, using the flag value: `--ecbp1100 99999999999` or equivalent).

## Rationale

While limited data circumscribes our understanding of the migration of the original roughly 1000 TH/s in the economy to a current value about 20% of that, it seems reasonable to conclude that the risks exposed by MESS now outweigh the risks it was designed to mitigate, since ETC accounts for around 80% of the current visible global rate.
