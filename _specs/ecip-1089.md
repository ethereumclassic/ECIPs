### Simple Summary

Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation _Istanbul_ network protocol upgrades on the Ethereum Classic network in a hard-fork code-named _Phoenix_ to enable maximum compatibility across these networks.

This is the _classic_ option equaling to an _Istanbul_ option without gas repricing.

### Abstract

Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the _Istanbul_ hardforks. The proposed changes for Ethereum Classic's _Phoenix_ upgrade include:

- Add Blake2 compression function `F` precompile
- Reduce alt_bn128 precompile gas costs
- Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps
- Add ChainID opcode
- Disable SSTORE with gasleft lower than call stipend
- Calldata gas cost reduction
- Add SELFBALANCE opcode

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:

- `999_983` on Mordor Classic PoW-testnet (April, 2020)
- `2_200_013` on Kotti Classic PoA-testnet (April, 2020)
- `10_500_839` on Ethereum Classic PoW-mainnet (June 10th, 2020)

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the _Specification_ section of this document.

### Motivation

To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities, various opcodes shall be added to the Ethereum Classic networks, all of which have been in use on the Ethereum Foundation networks since end of 2019.

### Specification

Technical specifications for each EIP can be found at those documents respectively:

- [EIP-152](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-152): Add Blake2 compression function `F` precompile
- [EIP-1108](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1108): Reduce alt_bn128 precompile gas costs
- [EIP-1283](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283): Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps
- [EIP-1344](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1344): Add ChainID opcode
- [EIP-1706](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1706): Disable SSTORE with gasleft lower than call stipend
- [EIP-2028](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028): Calldata gas cost reduction
- [ECIP-1080](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1080): Add SELFBALANCE opcode

### Rationale

__Interoperability__: Establishing and maintaining interoperable behavior between Ethereum clients is essential for developers and end-user adoption, yielding benefits for all participating chains (e.g., ETH and ETC, Ropsten and Mordor,
GÃ¶rli and Kotti).

__Immutability__: None of the introduced new opcodes in the EVM has the potential to change the behavior of existing contracts; in the case where previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode would have been deployed to the network, none of them would be able to modify the state of the Ethereum Classic networks retrospectively. Adding opcodes to the EVM increases its functionality and should be considered a feature upgrade rather than a modification.

### Implementation

Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible.

The following clients with Ethereum Classic support implement the _Istanbul_ features currently and would be able to support the _Phoenix_ upgrade:

- Hyperledger Besu
- Core-Geth
- Multi-Geth
- Parity Ethereum

### Final Note

Both, the Geth Classic client and the Morden testnet will no longer be supported by the community and not recieve the _Phoenix_ ugrades.

- Users of the Geth Classic client are urged to migrate their services to Parity Ethereum, Multi-Geth, or Hyperledger Besu. It is no longer recommended to run Geth Classic in production.
- Users of the Morden Classic testnet are urged to migrate their applications to the Kotti Classic or Morder Classic testnets.
