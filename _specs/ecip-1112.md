### Simple Summary

This proposal redirects the `BASEFEE` introduced by ECIP-1111 (via EIP-1559) from being burned to being deposited into an on-chain, protocol-defined treasury contract known as the **Olympia Treasury**. This mechanism establishes a sustainable and non-inflationary funding stream for Ethereum Classic by capturing fee revenue at the consensus layer. The treasury operates without trusted intermediaries and is designed to transparently fund long-term protocol development, client maintenance, infrastructure, and ecosystem security.

### Abstract

This ECIP defines the deployment and integration of the **Olympia Treasury**, a protocol-level smart contract at a fixed address on the Ethereum Classic network. Following the activation of ECIP-1111 (which introduces EIP-1559), all `BASEFEE` revenue will be redirected to this treasury contract instead of being burned.

The Olympia Treasury acts as a decentralized, immutable funding vault that accumulates protocol-level fee revenue. It is externally auditable, non-upgradable, and designed for secure interoperability with a permissionless governance layer (defined in ECIP-1113). Fund disbursement is executed via on-chain proposals submitted through Olympia DAO.

This model provides Ethereum Classic with a transparent, sustainable funding mechanism to support core client development, infrastructure, ecosystem tooling, and long-term security—without introducing inflation or relying on centralized intermediaries. The design aligns with established precedents from other EVM-compatible networks such as Ronin, Celo, and Mantle, which similarly redirect basefee revenue into protocol-owned treasuries.

### Motivation

Ethereum Classic currently lacks a sustainable and decentralized mechanism to fund core protocol development, infrastructure, tooling, and ecosystem growth. Historical funding has relied on short-term grants, centralized donors, or nonprofit foundations — many of which have ceased operations or withdrawn support.

Under ECIP-1017, block rewards are programmed to decline over time. As inflationary funding mechanisms taper off, Ethereum Classic must adopt a new model that is both durable and aligned with its core principles of immutability and Proof-of-Work.

Redirecting the `BASEFEE` introduced by EIP-1559 into the Olympia Treasury establishes a transparent, protocol-native source of funding derived from network usage. This approach:

- Aligns incentives between miners, users, and developers.
- Reinforces the long-term security and maintenance budget.
- Creates a sustainable public goods funding pathway without introducing inflation or centralization risks.

By capturing endogenous protocol revenue and directing it into a decentralized treasury, Ethereum Classic gains the financial tooling necessary to support long-term viability and ecosystem resilience.

### Specification

#### Contract Address

The Olympia Treasury contract SHALL be deployed at a fixed, deterministic address. This address SHALL be hardcoded into Ethereum Classic's consensus rules as the recipient of the `BASEFEE` defined in ECIP-1111.

- **Placeholder Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000OLYMPIA`  
  _(Final address to be derived via `CREATE` or `CREATE2` and published prior to testnet deployment in coordination with client implementers.)_

The address derivation MUST be reproducible across all client implementations to ensure deterministic deployment and cross-client consensus.

#### Funding Source

- **Fee Redirection**: 100% of the `BASEFEE` collected from EIP-1559 transactions SHALL be redirected to the Olympia Treasury contract.
- **Consensus Enforcement**: This redirection SHALL be enforced at the consensus layer starting from the activation block of ECIP-1111.

#### Contract Properties

The Olympia Treasury contract MUST satisfy the following technical constraints:

- Immutable deployment: No proxy patterns, upgrade hooks, or owner-controlled logic.
- No `selfdestruct` or `delegatecall` functionality.
- Standard logging: MUST emit `Transfer`, `Receive`, and `ProposalExecuted` events for full traceability.
- Full read transparency: Publicly accessible `view` methods for balance and transaction history.
- Withdrawal restrictions: EOAs MUST be prevented from directly initiating withdrawals.

#### Governance Interface

The Treasury SHALL expose an interface callable exclusively by a designated governance contract (see ECIP-1113). This interface MUST support:

- **Permissionless proposal intake** via governance-layer logic.
- **Authorized disbursement execution** via `release()` or `execute()` methods.
- **Flexible workflows**, such as milestone-based funding or time-locked transfers.
- **On-chain auditability** through event logging of all governance-initiated actions.

> Governance logic SHALL reside entirely outside the Treasury contract to maintain modularity and minimize attack surface.

#### Execution Control and Anti-Spam Protections

The Treasury contract MUST enforce strict access controls to mitigate unauthorized usage:

- **DAO-Only Execution**: Only the authorized DAO executor MAY invoke fund release functions. Unauthorized calls MUST revert.
- **Governance-Free Core**: The Treasury SHALL contain no embedded proposal or voting logic.
- **External Rate Limiting**: Proposal throughput MUST be rate-limited at the governance layer, reducing spam and denial-of-service risk.

These measures ensure the Olympia Treasury functions as a secure, auditable, and governance-controlled vault, while maintaining protocol-layer enforcement of fee redirection.

### Rationale

#### Minimalist Architecture for Network Maturity

The Olympia Treasury is deployed as a **simple, immutable vault**, free of internal governance or complex execution logic. Until governance is activated through ECIP-1113, it passively accumulates funds with **no risk of misuse or mismanagement**.

This architecture ensures:
- **Zero operational complexity** during early deployment phases  
- **No risk of unauthorized access or fund leakage**  
- **A stable foundation** for phased governance activation without imposing time pressure

Treasury functionality is intentionally minimized. All complexity — including proposal logic, vote execution, and disbursement conditions — is deferred to the external DAO layer, which can evolve independently and at the community’s pace.

#### Strategic Justifications

The Olympia Treasury contract is foundational to Ethereum Classic’s transition toward sustainable, decentralized funding. Its design supports the following strategic objectives:

- **Long-Term Security Budget**  
  As block rewards decrease under ECIP-1017, Ethereum Classic requires a durable, non-inflationary funding source. Redirecting the `BASEFEE` ensures the network retains native resources to support core development, infrastructure, audits, and upgrades — without relying on external donors.

- **Economic Incentive Alignment**  
  Linking funding to on-chain activity creates a positive feedback loop:
  > More dApps and users → More transactions → More treasury revenue → More development → More adoption.

- **Permissionless and Merit-Based Access**  
  In contrast to closed foundations or opaque grant committees, the Olympia Treasury enables any qualified contributor to request funding through transparent, on-chain governance.

- **Full Transparency and Accountability**  
  All inflows, proposals, votes, and disbursements are recorded on-chain. This eliminates ambiguity, mitigates favoritism, and builds long-term trust in how protocol revenue is managed.

- **Governance Modularity and Upgradeability**  
  By separating treasury logic from governance execution, Ethereum Classic gains flexibility to upgrade or replace the DAO (ECIP-1113) without altering the treasury itself. This decoupling reduces protocol risk and ensures continuity even if governance systems evolve or are replaced.

#### Ecosystem Precedents

The basefee redirection model adopted by Olympia has been validated across several EVM-compatible networks:

- **Ronin Network**  
  Redirects EIP-1559 `BASEFEE` to a DAO-governed treasury to fund Axie Infinity infrastructure.

- **Celo (L1)**  
  Directs gas fees to a carbon offset and community treasury via a Gas Fee Handler.

- **Mantle (L2)**  
  Uses sequencer fee redirection to fund ecosystem grants via MantleDAO.

These examples demonstrate that redirecting basefee revenue into protocol-owned treasuries is a practical and scalable mechanism for sustainable development funding.

#### Summary

The Olympia Treasury embodies Ethereum Classic’s core values — decentralization, transparency, immutability — while introducing a credible, on-chain funding pathway compatible with Proof-of-Work. Its minimalist, modular architecture ensures resilience, upgradeability, and community control over the protocol’s financial future.

### Related Work

The Olympia Treasury design draws inspiration from other EVM-compatible networks that have implemented protocol-level fee redirection to fund public goods and support DAO-managed treasuries. These implementations demonstrate the practical viability of using basefee or gas revenue as a sustainable, decentralized funding mechanism.

- **OP Stack (used by Base, Optimism)**  
  Implements EIP-1559 and supports custom sequencer fee splitting. Unlike other examples, it does **not** currently redirect `BASEFEE` to a DAO treasury — providing a useful contrast to full redirection models.

These examples illustrate a growing consensus among EVM-based networks: basefee redirection is a scalable and effective approach to fund ecosystem growth while maintaining protocol neutrality and decentralization.

### Implementation

The Olympia Treasury will be implemented in the [Core-Geth](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth) client as part of the Olympia network upgrade. This integration includes protocol-level changes to redirect `BASEFEE` revenues to a fixed treasury address defined in ECIP-1112.

#### Client Responsibilities

Client implementations MUST include the following changes:

- **Consensus Enforcement**:  
  Hardcode the Olympia Treasury address in the consensus layer as the sole recipient of the `BASEFEE` from each block.

- **Redirection Logic**:  
  Replace the default burn behavior of EIP-1559 with a transfer of the `BASEFEE` to the treasury contract.

- **Gas Accounting Integrity**:  
  Update all gas accounting and transaction validation logic to reflect the redirection, ensuring compatibility with EIP-1559 mechanics.

#### Deployment Artifacts

- The treasury contract’s **bytecode**, **deployment method**, and **deterministic address** will be published with the Olympia upgrade release.
- Deployment will use `CREATE` or `CREATE2`, allowing reproducibility across clients.
- The contract will undergo formal security auditing prior to mainnet deployment.

#### Test Coverage and Validation

Comprehensive test cases will be provided to verify correct functionality, including:

- Accurate `BASEFEE` transfer to the treasury address in every block.
- Emission of expected `Transfer` and governance-related events.
- Compatibility with governance interfaces (`propose()`, `release()`, `execute()`).
- Full Mordor Testnet simulation for consensus consistency and replay validation.

These implementation steps ensure the Olympia Treasury is securely embedded into Ethereum Classic’s base protocol, with verifiable behavior across client software and network participants.

### Modular Treasury Deployment

The Olympia Treasury is designed as a standalone, immutable smart contract that can be deployed and activated independently of the DAO governance system (ECIP-1113) or legal execution interface (ECIP-1114). Its architecture enables phased deployment and reduces coordination complexity.

#### Pre-Governance Activation

- Upon deployment, the Treasury contract can **begin accumulating `BASEFEE` revenue** immediately following activation of ECIP-1111.
- It does **not require active governance contracts** or execution interfaces to function as a passive vault.

#### Security During Accumulation Phase

- All disbursement functions (`release()`, `execute()`) are **inaccessible** until triggered by the authorized DAO executor.
- Any withdrawal attempts from EOAs or unauthorized contracts will be **automatically rejected**, ensuring fund immutability during the interim period.

#### Deployment Advantages

- **Forward Compatibility**:  
  The treasury is ready to integrate with governance modules once finalized, without requiring changes to the contract itself.

- **Security Isolation**:  
  The decoupled deployment isolates treasury logic from governance logic, minimizing risk exposure during early adoption stages.

- **Phased Rollout Support**:  
  This modular structure supports a staggered implementation of ECIPs 1111–1114, giving the community time to test, audit, and activate governance systems without delaying treasury accumulation.

This modular approach reflects best practices in protocol design — enabling early utility, minimizing upgrade risk, and maintaining flexibility for future governance integration.

### Backwards Compatibility

The Olympia Treasury contract modifies the default behavior introduced by EIP-1559 by redirecting the `BASEFEE` to a fixed treasury address instead of burning it. This change is enforced at the protocol level and requires client-side implementation as part of the Olympia upgrade (ECIP-1111).

#### Impact on Nodes

- **Upgraded Clients**:  
  Nodes that upgrade will recognize the Treasury contract and process the `BASEFEE` redirect correctly.

- **Legacy Clients**:  
  Nodes that do not upgrade will remain unaware of:
  - Type-2 transactions introduced by EIP-1559  
  - The Treasury contract address hardcoded into consensus  
  This results in a **permanent consensus fork** from the canonical Ethereum Classic chain.

#### Compatibility with Legacy Contracts

- The redirect does **not affect Type-0 transactions** or existing contracts that do not interact with fee logic.
- All previously deployed smart contracts will continue to execute normally.
- The system remains fully **forward-compatible** with existing dApps, tools, and transaction formats that are EIP-1559-agnostic.

This approach preserves historical behavior for legacy participants while introducing modern features in a strictly opt-in, upgrade-controlled manner.

### Security Considerations

The Olympia Treasury contract is engineered with strict safeguards to uphold immutability, enforce access control, and preserve consensus integrity. Security guarantees are structured across five key domains:

---

#### 1. Contract Immutability and Access Control

- **Immutable Deployment**:  
  The contract is deployed with no upgrade path — it uses fixed bytecode, no proxy pattern, no `delegatecall`, and no administrative modifiers.  
  No party, including the DAO, can alter its logic post-deployment.

- **Restricted Execution**:  
  Only the authorized DAO executor contract may invoke `release()` or `execute()` functions.  
  All calls from EOAs or unauthorized contracts will revert by design.

- **Minimal Surface Area**:  
  The contract implements only essential permission checks and fund transfers.  
  Its simplicity minimizes exploitable logic and reduces attack vectors.

---

#### 2. DAO Integration and Governance Risks

- **Governance Failures (Out-of-Scope)**:  
  Risks such as proposal spam, vote manipulation, or collusion reside at the DAO layer (see ECIP-1113).  
  Expected mitigations include:
  - Time delays for proposal review  
  - Multisig proposal guards  
  - Quorum-based on-chain voting with transparency

- **Treasury Hardening Against DAO Capture**:  
  Even in the event of DAO compromise, funds remain locked unless a valid, quorum-approved proposal is executed through the DAO’s authorized interface.

---

#### 3. Client Enforcement and Consensus Safety

- **Mandatory Consensus Enforcement**:  
  Clients MUST enforce protocol-level redirection of `BASEFEE` to the treasury.  
  Any deviation results in a permanent fork from the canonical Ethereum Classic chain.

- **Replay Protection**:  
  As with all network upgrades, transaction replay protection is required to prevent cross-fork leakage and execution ambiguity.

---

#### 4. Replay Safety and Execution Integrity

- **Chain-Specific Verification**:  
  Disbursement payloads MUST include `chain ID` and a proposal-specific hash.  
  This ensures execution is confined to the intended chain and governance action.

- **Proposal Binding**:  
  Treasury disbursements are strictly bound to successful proposals.  
  Without a valid, DAO-initiated trigger, execution attempts are rejected.

---

#### 5. Audit and Testing Strategy

- **Independent Security Audits**:  
  The Treasury contract will undergo formal audits by third-party security firms, independent of DAO contracts.

- **Formal Verification**:  
  Static analysis tools (e.g., Slither, MythX) will be used to validate logic soundness and detect vulnerabilities.

- **Comprehensive Testnet Validation**:  
  Full functionality — including basefee redirection and governance-triggered disbursement — will be tested on the Mordor Testnet prior to mainnet activation.

---

#### Summary

The Olympia Treasury is intentionally minimal, immutable, and governance-isolated. Its hardened access model, enforced consensus logic, and transparent audit trail protect against both technical exploits and governance capture. Through rigorous audits, replay protection, and modular design, the contract provides a robust foundation for sustainable on-chain funding on Ethereum Classic.
