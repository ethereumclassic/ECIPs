### Simple Summary

Redirect the `BASEFEE` introduced by ECIP-1111 from being burned to instead funding a protocol-level smart contract treasuryâ€”referred to as the Olympia Treasury. This enables sustainable, on-chain funding for Ethereum Classic without inflation, aligns ecosystem incentives across miners, users, and developers, and establishes a long-term security budget as emissions decline under ECIP-1017.

### Abstract

This ECIP proposes the specification and deployment of a protocol-level smart contract referred to as the Olympia Treasury, which redirects the `BASEFEE` introduced in ECIP-1111 (EIP-1559) into a dedicated on-chain funding contract rather than burning it. This creates a sustainable, transparent, and permissionless development fund for Ethereum Classic. The Treasury is deployed at a protocol-defined address and receives the full `BASEFEE` from each block, enabling native funding of the ecosystem as block rewards diminish under ECIP-1017.

### Motivation

Ethereum Classic lacks an open and decentralized funding mechanism for sustaining public goods, including core protocol development, client maintenance, infrastructure services, ecosystem tooling, and grants. Historically, funding has been limited to off-chain entities or closed treasuries backed by inflationary emissions.

This ECIP enables a permissionless and transparent treasury, funded by existing fees rather than inflation. It aligns incentives across miners, developers, and users and ensures Ethereum Classic retains a long-term security budget and governance pathway as block rewards decline over time.

### Specification

#### Contract Address

The Olympia Treasury contract SHALL be deployed at a fixed, deterministic address. This address is hardcoded into the consensus rules as the recipient of the `BASEFEE` portion of every block under EIP-1559.

- Address (placeholder): `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000OLYMPIA`

#### Funding Source

- The full value of the `BASEFEE` as defined by EIP-1559 SHALL be transferred to the Olympia Treasury contract each block.

- This redirect is protocol-level and enforced by client software upon activation of the Olympia hard fork.

#### Contract Properties

The Olympia Treasury contract MUST:

- Be immutable and non-upgradeable after deployment, with no proxy, delegatecall, or admin modifiers.
- Support transparent on-chain balance inspection.
- Emit standard `Transfer` and `Receive` logs for public observability.
- Contain no externally owned account (EOA) administrative controls or centralized withdrawal methods.

#### Governance Interface

The Treasury SHALL integrate with a DAO contract (Olympia DAO) that:

- Proposes and approves funding proposals.
- Schedules and releases funds via time-locked execution mechanisms.
- Requires multi-signature or token-weighted governance for withdrawal authorization.

Interoperability SHALL be implemented via standard function selectors (`propose()`, `release()`, `execute()`) callable by governance contracts. Details of the Olympia DAO may evolve independently but MUST remain permissionlessly interoperable with the Treasury.

#### Activation Block

The redirection of `BASEFEE` to the Olympia Treasury SHALL activate at the same block height as ECIP-1111 (Olympia Upgrade).

### Rationale

- **Security Budget**: Ensures Ethereum Classic has a sustainable source of funding beyond finite emissions.
- **Neutrality**: Avoids inflation or privileged allocations; BASEFEE is collected from all users and is verifiable on-chain.
- **Alignment**: Connects miners, developers, and users to the same on-chain economy, reinforcing mutual benefit.
- **Governance Flexibility**: Enables community-controlled allocation of fees toward ecosystem growth.
- **Transparency**: All funding flows are visible and verifiable on-chain, avoiding opaque off-chain grants.

### Implementation

To be implemented in [Core-Geth](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth).

- Treasury contract bytecode and deterministic address generation scripts will be included in the Olympia fork activation PR.
- Example test cases will be provided to validate correct `BASEFEE` redirection.

### Backwards Compatibility

This ECIP is not backward-compatible. It alters the default behavior of EIP-1559 by redirecting the `BASEFEE` instead of burning it. Client software MUST implement this redirect as part of the Olympia hard fork.

### Security Considerations

No new consensus-critical vulnerabilities are introduced by this upgrade. The `BASEFEE` opcode and EIP-1559 transaction format have been widely adopted and audited across the EVM ecosystem. Core-Geth implementers are advised to validate integration against existing test vectors and consensus tests.
