### Simple Summary

This ECIP introduces an optional, governance-layer L-curve smoothing mechanism that allocates a configurable portion of Treasury-held BASEFEE revenue to miners as a long-term network security budget.  
The model applies a deterministic smoothing curve to distribute revenue from each block across a future window, providing predictable miner incentives as block rewards decline over time.

This mechanism does not modify consensus or BASEFEE redirection under ECIP-1111.  
All smoothing and allocation logic operates at the application and governance layer, using the Treasury defined in ECIP-1112 and the execution path defined in ECIP-1113 and ECIP-1114.

### Abstract

ECIP-1115 defines an optional L-curve smoothing model that allocates a portion of BASEFEE revenue stored in the Olympia Treasury to miners through a governance-controlled distribution process.  
A deterministic smoothing window spreads the effective value of each block’s BASEFEE across future blocks, producing a predictable and configurable miner revenue profile intended to support long-term network security as fixed issuance declines.

This ECIP introduces no changes to consensus, BASEFEE computation, or redirection rules defined in ECIP-1111.  
The mechanism operates entirely at the governance and application layers and may be adopted, tuned, or disabled through the standard Olympia DAO process.

### Motivation

Under ECIP-1111, all BASEFEE amounts are redirected to the immutable Olympia Treasury.  
As block rewards decrease over time under Ethereum Classic’s fixed-emission policy, transaction fees are expected to compose a growing share of miner revenue, influencing long-term Proof-of-Work security.

BASEFEE inflows may vary significantly between blocks due to normal fluctuations in network activity.  
A smoothing mechanism that distributes a portion of these revenues across a defined future window can provide a more stable and predictable miner revenue profile without modifying consensus behavior.

ECIP-1115 formalizes such a model as an optional, governance-layer component of the Olympia framework.  
The mechanism allows BASEFEE-derived miner incentives to be expressed through a configurable smoothing function while preserving the Treasury’s consensus-layer role and maintaining full compatibility with ECIP-1112–1114.

### Specification

#### 1. Scope

This ECIP defines an optional governance-layer mechanism for distributing a portion of BASEFEE revenue, accumulated by the Olympia Treasury under ECIP-1111 and ECIP-1112, to miners using a deterministic L-curve smoothing model.  
This mechanism:

- operates entirely at the application and governance layer,  
- introduces no consensus changes, and  
- relies on the Governor → Timelock → Executor pipeline defined in ECIP-1113 and ECIP-1114.

Consensus rules and client software do not require changes for this ECIP.
Miners are only affected at the economic layer via governance-controlled Treasury payouts.

#### 2. Smoothing Model

The smoothing mechanism uses a deterministic weighting function (“L-curve”) applied over a configurable window of future blocks or governance-defined periods.
Given a block with BASEFEE-derived revenue `R`, a smoothing function `L(i)` defines the fraction of `R` allocated to index `i` within a window of length `N`.

The following constraints apply:

- `L(i)` MUST be deterministic and fully on-chain computable.  
- `L(i)` MUST sum to 1 across the window:  
  Σ₍ᵢ₌₁→ᴺ₎ L(i) = 1  
- The window size `N` MUST be configurable through the Olympia Improvement Proposal (OIP) process.  
- The shape of the L-curve MAY be piecewise, linear, exponential, or parameterized, but MUST be fixed for a given configuration.

This ECIP does not mandate a specific functional form; it defines the framework within which one operates.

#### 3. Allocation Rule

A smoothing module SHALL compute a sequence of scheduled miner allocations based on:

- total Treasury BASEFEE inflows for each block,  
- the active smoothing window `N`, and  
- the active weighting function `L(i)`.

Let `R_k` denote the Treasury’s BASEFEE revenue from block `k`.

For a given configuration, governance MAY specify a fraction `f` of Treasury-held BASEFEE to be subject to smoothing, such that `R_k` denotes only that fraction (0 ≤ f ≤ 1) of the BASEFEE revenue from block `k`.

The smoothed allocation for miner-reward index `j` is:

A_{k+j} = R_k × L(j)

All allocations MUST be applied only after funds reside in the Treasury and MUST be expressed as standard Treasury disbursements executed through the ECIP-1113 governance pipeline.

#### 4. Miner Distribution Mechanism

Funds designated for miners MUST be distributed through a governance-controlled miner distribution contract (the “Miner Reward Module”).  
This module MAY:

- reference mining pool addresses,  
- reference miner self-declared payout addresses, or  
- use a validated hashpower attestation mechanism.

This ECIP does not mandate any particular miner identification or weighting method; such configuration SHALL occur via OIP.

The Treasury MUST only release smoothed funds to the Miner Reward Module when:

- the distribution has been authorized by a successful governance action, and  
- execution occurs via the authorized Executor under ECIP-1113.

#### 5. Governance Integration

All parameters of the smoothing mechanism — including:

- the smoothing window `N`,  
- the L-curve definition,  
- the percentage of Treasury BASEFEE allocated to miners,  
- the Miner Reward Module address,  
- and any required distribution policy—

MUST be adjustable solely through the Olympia Improvement Proposal (OIP) process defined in ECIP-1113.

This ECIP defines the mechanism; OIPs define the operating parameters.

#### 6. Treasury Behavior

This ECIP does not modify the Treasury contract defined in ECIP-1112.  
Funds remain under Treasury custody until withdrawn through:

Governor → Timelock → Executor → Treasury

as required by ECIP-1113 and ECIP-1114.

The smoothing mechanism computes intended allocations but does not bypass, modify, or replace Treasury access controls.

#### 7. Optionality

The smoothing mechanism is optional.  
The DAO MAY activate, modify, suspend, or disable smoothing via OIP without requiring a network fork.

If smoothing is inactive, BASEFEE revenue distribution remains unchanged and entirely under standard ECIP-1114 funding proposal processes.

### Rationale

ECIP-1111 redirects all BASEFEE revenue to the Olympia Treasury, creating a non-inflationary source of protocol-level funding.  
As fixed block rewards decline over time, transaction-fee–derived revenue becomes an increasingly important component of long-term Proof-of-Work security.

BASEFEE inflows may fluctuate substantially between blocks due to normal variations in network demand.  
A smoothing mechanism distributes the effective value of these inflows across a defined window, producing a predictable miner-revenue profile without modifying consensus or BASEFEE redirection rules.

Defining the smoothing mechanism at the governance and application layer preserves:

- the immutability and simplicity of consensus logic,  
- the integrity of the Treasury contract (ECIP-1112), and  
- the modular governance model established in ECIP-1113 and ECIP-1114.

This allows the network to experiment with miner-reward structures and long-term security budgeting while keeping the mechanism adjustable through standard governance processes.  
Parameter flexibility ensures that the smoothing window, weighting curve, and reward share can be updated as empirical data becomes available, without requiring protocol-level changes.

### Backwards Compatibility

ECIP-1115 introduces no changes to Ethereum Classic’s consensus rules, block structure, transaction formats, gas mechanics, or state-transition logic.  
BASEFEE computation and redirection under ECIP-1111 remain unchanged.

All smoothing and allocation logic operates exclusively at the application and governance layer using the Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112), the governance execution model (ECIP-1113), and the funding-proposal framework (ECIP-1114).

Nodes that do not implement ECIP-1115 retain full consensus compatibility and can continue to validate blocks normally.  
Such nodes will simply not participate in governance transactions that configure or execute smoothing-related distributions.

Because Treasury disbursements are standard contract calls executed via the Governor → Timelock → Executor pipeline, existing clients and tooling remain unaffected.  
No migrations, state recalculations, or protocol-level adjustments are required.

### Security Considerations

ECIP-1115 introduces no changes to consensus behavior and does not modify BASEFEE computation, opcode semantics, or block validation.  
All security risks are therefore limited to the governance and application layers.

The following considerations apply:

1. **Treasury Isolation**  
   The Olympia Treasury’s immutable access-control rules defined in ECIP-1112 remain unchanged.  
   Smoothing calculations do not alter Treasury state and are only applied after a successful governance action.

2. **Governance Authorization**  
   All miner-distribution operations must pass through the Governor → Timelock → Executor pipeline defined in ECIP-1113.  
   No module introduced by this ECIP may bypass timelock delays, modify Treasury code, or introduce privileged execution paths.

3. **Deterministic Allocation**  
   The smoothing mechanism must use deterministic, on-chain computable functions.  
   Allocation rules must not depend on off-chain data or discretionary external inputs.

4. **Miner Identification**  
   The method for identifying miner recipients (e.g., mining pools, self-declared payout addresses, or attestations) must be configured through governance.  
   This ECIP does not mandate a specific mechanism; however, any such mechanism must avoid granting unilateral authority to off-chain parties.

5. **Parameter Changes**  
   Smoothing parameters—such as the window length, weighting function, and payout share—may only be modified through OIP-governed actions.  
   Abrupt or frequent reconfiguration could create inconsistent expectations among participants but does not affect consensus safety.

6. **Optionality**  
   The smoothing mechanism is optional.  
   If disabled, BASEFEE-derived funds remain fully governed by the standard ECIP-1114 proposal process with no impact on network operation.

Because all logic introduced by ECIP-1115 is executed at the governance layer and relies exclusively on standard Treasury withdrawal semantics, consensus-level security guarantees are preserved.

### Implementation Notes

This ECIP defines a framework for implementing an optional L-curve smoothing mechanism at the governance and application layer.  
It does not mandate a specific contract architecture or parameter set.  
The following notes outline the expected implementation boundaries:

1. **Module Structure**  
   The smoothing logic SHOULD be implemented in a standalone contract or module (the “Smoothing Module”) responsible for:
   - receiving smoothing configuration parameters,  
   - computing deterministic allocation schedules, and  
   - preparing the calldata required for Treasury disbursements.

2. **Governance Integration**  
   The Smoothing Module SHOULD expose functions callable only by the governance executor defined in ECIP-1113.  
   Parameter updates, activation, or deactivation MUST occur through the standard OIP process.

3. **Treasury Interaction**  
   The Smoothing Module does not hold funds.  
   It MUST compute payout amounts and recipient addresses, but all transfers MUST be executed via:
   Governor → Timelock → Executor → Treasury,
   as specified in ECIP-1112 and ECIP-1113.

4. **Miner Reward Module**  
   Miner payout distribution SHOULD occur through a separate module (“Miner Reward Module”).  
   This module MAY:
   - store miner or pool payout addresses,  
   - compute proportional shares, or  
   - serve as a passthrough to an attestation-based system.  
   This ECIP does not prescribe a specific method.

5. **Off-Chain Tooling**  
   Dashboards, explorers, and accounting tools MAY read smoothing schedules or module parameters to present projected miner-reward streams.  
   Off-chain tools are NOT normative and MUST NOT be required for correct on-chain operation.

6. **Optional Deployment**  
   Networks and implementations MAY deploy the Smoothing Module and Miner Reward Module prior to activating smoothing, provided no module is granted Treasury withdrawal authority until explicitly configured by governance.

7. **Parameter Defaults**  
   No default smoothing parameters are specified by this ECIP.  
   All initial values—including smoothing windows, weighting functions, and reward shares—MUST be defined by an OIP before the mechanism becomes active.

These notes describe expected implementation patterns but do not impose architectural requirements beyond the constraints defined in this ECIP.
