###  NOTE

The ECIP was replaced by [ECIP-1090 - ECIP process](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/277/files)
and was never activated.


### Abstract

Both [soc1c](https://github.com/soc1c) and [meowbits](https://github.com/meowbits) have
made it crystal clear in multiple posts across Github and the ETC Discord server
that they do not want their real names to be used in ECIP-1000 anymore, but instead
will be using "Talha Cross" and "Mr. Meows D. Bits" respectively as their pseudonyms.

Their contact details remain the same and they are readily contactable.


### Motivation

Donald expressed this [very well](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/236#issuecomment-574242091)
in a recent Github comment:

"... it is absolutely acceptable to work pseudonymously. It is a long tradition of
decades in the cypherpunk philosophy (the source and likely creators or Bitcoin) and
Bitcoin, the first implementation of a PoW blockchain, was, in fact, created by a
pseudonymous individual or team.

As it is imperative in the crypto industries (both cryptography and blockchain) to let
people work in the level of privacy they prefer, it is irrelevant for the ECIP process
what names contributors choose to use, therefore it is not appropriate, "important",
nor advisable to mark participants by their levels of privacy."
