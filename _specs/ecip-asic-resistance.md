## Abstract

"ASIC resistance" is a myth.  The ETC ecosystem rejects this myth.

This ECIP seeks to bring certainty that decisions around ETC mining
are not being guided by an easily disprovable myth, but by the
application of science, measurement and facts - not subjective
personal beliefs.


## Rationale

The Ethereum Classic project "inherited" both philosophy and
implementation decisions from the Ethereum project which are
in conflict with the "Immutable, Decentralized, Unstoppable"
philosophy and ethos of ETC.

The first break which ETC made against such inheritance was with
Monetary Policy, where the lack of clear monetary policy in
Ethereum, while not problematic for the ETH2 ("World Computer")
project, was a huge problem for ETC ("Bitcoin with state and
smart contracts").  That project needs a "hard money" basis.

[ECIP 1017: Monetary Policy and Final Modification to the Ethereum Classic Emission Schedule](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1017)

Getting to human consensus on the Monetary Policy change was hard,
because the change was in conflict with Immutability doctrine.
Changing consensus rules in any way is very problematic to some people.

Monetary policy was seen as something where there was very
broad consensus that the inherited lack of monetary policy was a
major problem for ETC.  Breaking immutability in that way so
that immutability could be preserved with respect to monetary
policy on a multi-decade basis moving forward was seen as a
worthwhile tradeoff.

"ASIC resistance" is another instance of a "bad inheritance" which
could be fixed so that ETC ecosystem participants can have
multi-decade certainty around mining as well as monetary policy.

"She stated that ASIC resistance was, indeed, a 'myth' and a 'fallacy',
adding that Proof-of-Work required “some form of ASIC to do the work”."

"Is ASIC resistance a myth?  Aren't GPUs ASICs too?"

 - [Bob Summerwill, Executive Director, ETC Cooperative](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobsummerwill/)

"An important thing to clarify here is when you say "ASIC resistance",
those people who are for "ASIC resistance" are not against something
called ASIC.  They are against something which is a custom hardware
which is more efficient to the hardware available to the masses, or
general hardware.  So, I do believe ASIC resistance in that way is futile,
because there will be some custom hardware always.  If you have a
coin which is worth mining then somebody will find a more efficient
way of mining it, where it is ASICs or some other way, which gives them
equal advantage that ASIC cannot.  For example, maybe I live in a
country where I have good connection to the government and can get
almost free electicity.  Now, I am maybe 1000x more efficient than
someone, without buying any ASICs.  If you are against ASICs in that
way, you are just against competition"

 - [Nishant Sharma, Head of International PR and Community Relations, Bitmain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishantsharma87/)

"I think ASIC resistance is more of a philosophy than a practical approach
you can implement.  If you look at things: GPUs are ASICs. CPUs are ASICs
and the blockchain processes we make are ASICs.  Fundamentally the
philosophy behind "ASIC resistance" has been to make things products
memory hard. And so, what you end up doing, is you are buying GPUs
primarily to be "ASIC resistant". You pay a lot for memory and inherently
the hash rate is a lot slower.  Philosophies around "ASIC resistance" are
that it is widely available. You can go to AMD or NVIDIA to buy those
products. But fundamentally it is not a good mining solution.  You can
see that in today's world and very shortly that GPUs are not profitable
and we see that as technology moves along the GPUs will be dwarfed by ASICs."
