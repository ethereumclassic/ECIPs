### Abstract
Taking after [core dev call 18](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/434), we want to look into forking mainnet into a separate network to test Keccak mining and transitions between etchash and keccak mining and vice versa. 

### Motivation
We are looking to create a situation where we transition across proof of work algorithms and require something that looks as close as possible as the real thing.

### Specification
We want to select a block of ETC mainnet and take all account information, sent to a separate network.
The network must have a different chain id.
The network must allow to change the proof of work algorithm in use.
It should be possible to change the proof of work algorithm back and forth between etchash and keccak.
TBD whether the change should be cyclical or on demand.

### Rationale
We want to make sure we can easily change between proof of work algorithms.
In particular, we want to make sure we can adjust difficulty faster during the adjustment period of the algorithm.

### Backwards compatibility
TBD

### Reference implementation
TBD
