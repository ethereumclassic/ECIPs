### Simple Summary

This ECIP defines the on-chain governance framework for the Olympia DAO, the decentralized organization responsible for managing Ethereum Classic’s protocol-level treasury (as established in ECIP-1112). Olympia DAO enables permissionless proposal submission, token-weighted voting, and accountable execution of development funding through the Olympia Treasury, aligning governance with the network’s long-term sustainability and decentralization principles.

**No governance token exists at launch. Any token design, supply, or distribution must be proposed and approved transparently through DAO governance.**


### Abstract

This ECIP specifies the structure, roles, and functions of the Olympia DAO — a decentralized autonomous organization that governs the Olympia Treasury contract (ECIP-1112) and oversees the allocation of on-chain development funds on Ethereum Classic. The DAO framework supports permissionless proposal submission, transparent community voting, and time-locked execution of approved proposals.

The Olympia DAO is implemented as a smart contract system composed of governance logic, voting mechanisms, and disbursement interfaces. It operates independently from any central authority and is governed by ETC stakeholders via open participation in decision-making through on-chain processes. The DAO ensures that Ethereum Classic’s protocol-level funding — sourced from redirected BASEFEE revenue per ECIP-1112 — is allocated fairly, transparently, and in alignment with the network’s values of decentralization, immutability, and sovereignty.

### Motivation

Ethereum Classic’s development has historically relied on a small number of centralized entities or foundation-style organizations to manage funding, often with opaque processes and limited community oversight. This has led to gatekeeping, inconsistent support, and misalignment between contributors and the long-term interests of the network.

With the activation of ECIP-1111 (EIP-1559) and ECIP-1112 (Olympia Treasury), Ethereum Classic now has a native, protocol-level funding stream derived from transaction fees. To ensure this funding is allocated in a decentralized, permissionless, and transparent manner, the network requires a governance system capable of managing these resources without reliance on trusted third parties.

The Olympia DAO is designed to:

- Democratize access to funding for developers, infrastructure providers, and public goods contributors.
- Eliminate centralized control over grant disbursements.
- Create an open, auditable process for proposing and approving funding initiatives.
- Encourage broader participation in Ethereum Classic governance.

By transitioning from a model of discretionary funding to one based on on-chain rules and stakeholder consensus, Ethereum Classic reinforces its commitment to sovereignty, neutrality, and long-term sustainability.

Other EVM networks such as Ronin, Celo, and Mantle have adopted similar governance architectures where protocol fee revenue is directed to DAO-controlled treasuries. Olympia DAO builds on these proven designs, enabling Ethereum Classic to govern its basefee-derived treasury with transparency, decentralization, and permissionless participation — all without altering ETC’s monetary policy or Proof-of-Work consensus.

### Specification

#### Governance Model

The Olympia DAO SHALL operate as a smart contract system deployed on Ethereum Classic and SHALL govern the disbursement of funds from the Olympia Treasury (see ECIP-1112).

The DAO MUST include the following core components:

- **Proposal Submission**: Any address SHALL be allowed to submit a funding proposal via the DAO contract interface. Proposals MUST specify:
  - Requested funding amount
  - Target recipient address
  - Purpose and scope of work
  - Proposed disbursement schedule (e.g., milestones, vesting, single payout)

- **Voting Mechanism**: Proposals SHALL be subject to an on-chain voting process governed by a transparent stake-based or reputation-based system. Initial implementation MAY use token-weighted voting (e.g., staked ETC, a soulbound participation token such as veOLY, or quadratic models), subject to future upgrade. No governance token exists at deployment. The creation, distribution, and rules for any governance token (e.g., veOLY) MUST be proposed and approved transparently through DAO vote, with no premine or insider allocation permitted.


- **Quorum and Thresholds**:
  - A minimum quorum MUST be required for any vote to pass.
  - Funding proposals MUST meet a configurable approval threshold (e.g., 60% yes votes) to proceed.

- **Execution Engine**: Upon successful vote, the DAO SHALL schedule the approved transaction for execution. Execution MAY be time-locked to allow for review and emergency veto mechanisms.

- **Treasury Interaction**: The DAO contract MUST be authorized to call functions on the Olympia Treasury contract (ECIP-1112), including `release()` and `execute()` for fund disbursement.

- **Transparency Logs**: All proposals, votes, and fund transfers MUST be logged on-chain and indexed for public inspection.

#### Contract Properties

- DAO logic MUST be implemented as modular, upgradeable smart contracts with clear interfaces. Any upgrade paths MUST be governed via on-chain proposal, meet quorum and threshold requirements, and include a timelocked delay before execution.

- The DAO SHALL have no centralized admin control over treasury funds.

- Emergency governance MAY be enabled via a time-locked, community-elected multi-signature fallback. This multisig SHALL be authorized only to:
  - Pause proposal execution,
  - Reject or quarantine clearly malicious proposals,
  - Trigger a DAO reinitialization vote in case of governance failure or capture.

  The multisig SHALL NOT have the ability to:
  - Submit new funding proposals,
  - Disburse treasury funds,
  - Override DAO votes or execution without explicit on-chain reauthorization.

  Activation of the emergency multisig MUST be triggered via governance vote, SHALL be time-limited (e.g., 30-day emergency state), and MUST be publicly auditable. This mechanism exists solely to defend against stagnation or capture — not to replace decentralized governance.

- The Olympia Treasury contract (defined in ECIP-1112) is immutable. It SHALL only respond to authorized calls from the DAO executor contract and SHALL reject any upgrades, direct admin intervention, or withdrawal requests from unauthorized sources. This separation ensures that even if the DAO is upgraded, treasury funds remain secure and auditable under immutable rules.


### Rationale

Ethereum Classic has long lacked a credible, open, and transparent governance process for allocating protocol-level funds. Historically, development efforts were funded off-chain by private actors, centralized foundations, or non-transparent grant programs — often leading to mistrust, misalignment, and fragmentation.

The Olympia DAO introduces a permissionless, on-chain governance system that reflects Ethereum Classic’s values of decentralization, immutability, and sovereignty. By integrating directly with the Olympia Treasury, the DAO enables protocol revenue to be allocated toward public goods through a community-driven process.

Key motivations include:

- **Neutrality**: Governance is not controlled by any single entity or foundation. Any network participant may submit proposals and vote.

- **Transparency**: All actions — from proposal to disbursement — are logged on-chain, providing full visibility into the funding lifecycle.

- **Sustainability**: Funding is tied to protocol activity, allowing Ethereum Classic to bootstrap ecosystem growth without relying on inflation or donations.

- **Security and Modularity**: Separating treasury and governance logic enables upgrades to the DAO contract without compromising treasury integrity.

- **Resilience**: Open governance enables a diverse and global group of participants to shape Ethereum Classic’s roadmap, making the network more resilient to capture or stagnation.

- **On Plutocracy Risk and Voting Design**  
  A common critique of token-weighted voting systems is that they may disproportionately empower large holders (“whales”) while excluding valuable contributors without significant capital. The Olympia DAO governance model acknowledges this concern and is intentionally designed with modularity and upgradeability to support alternative models over time.

  While the initial implementation may use token-weighted or stake-based voting for simplicity and auditability, the DAO supports migration to more inclusive models — such as soulbound reputation tokens, quadratic voting, delegated councils, or Proof-of-Contribution attestations — through future governance proposals.

  Importantly, the Olympia DAO does **not predefine or pre-allocate any governance token**. Its issuance, supply, and distribution model must be proposed and approved through the DAO itself, allowing the community to shape governance incentives in a transparent, merit-based way. This flexibility ensures that governance remains aligned with Ethereum Classic’s values of sovereignty, openness, and resistance to centralized control.

- **DAO vs. Multisig Governance**  
  A common alternative to DAO-based governance is to use a multisignature wallet managed by a small group of trusted individuals. While multisigs are simpler to deploy and have been used effectively in some early ecosystems, they introduce centralization risks, opaque decision-making, and limited scalability.

  The Olympia Upgrade deliberately avoids placing treasury control in the hands of any small group — no matter how well-intentioned — in favor of a permissionless, transparent governance process where funding decisions are made by the community through public proposals and on-chain voting.

  Key limitations of multisig-based funding models include:
  - **Closed Membership**: Only selected signers may participate in decision-making.
  - **Limited Transparency**: Rationale for fund disbursements may not be recorded or auditable.
  - **Stagnation Risk**: If multisig signers go inactive, governance halts.
  - **No Community Accountability**: The wider network has no formal voice in fund allocation.

  In contrast, a DAO-based system:
  - Enables **open proposal submission** by anyone.
  - Enforces **transparent voting**, quorum, and execution rules.
  - **Separates execution from discretion**, reducing trust assumptions.
  - Is **upgradeable and resilient**, supporting future improvements to voting and accountability mechanisms.

  - **On Inactivity, Capture, and Fallback Recovery**  
  A legitimate concern in any DAO system is the risk of governance stagnation (low participation) or capture (whale dominance). To address this without undermining decentralization, the Olympia DAO includes an optional, strictly limited fallback: a time-locked emergency multisig that can pause execution or trigger recovery votes, but **cannot spend funds** or override the will of the community.

  This fallback ensures that if the DAO becomes non-functional — whether due to inactivity, vote deadlock, or smart contract failure — the community retains a controlled mechanism to restore governance integrity. Critically, the fallback multisig is elected by DAO vote, and its powers are revocable, auditable, and time-limited.

  This approach avoids hardcoding centralized control or privileged roles, while still protecting the protocol’s development pipeline from being frozen indefinitely.

  The Olympia DAO still supports the use of a **time-locked, emergency multisig** as a last-resort mechanism to pause or delay malicious proposals — but never to approve or spend funds unilaterally. This preserves decentralization while mitigating unforeseen governance attacks.

### Related Work

Olympia DAO draws inspiration from governance frameworks and DAO-treasury integrations used across the EVM ecosystem:

- **Celo**: Implements community-governed treasury flows through its Gas Fee Handler and Carbon Offset Reserve, funded by gas fee redirection.
- **Ronin Network**: Utilizes tokenholder governance to manage a basefee-funded treasury for ecosystem grants and validator rewards.
- **Mantle**: Employs a modular DAO system (MantleDAO) to manage sequencer-generated protocol fees in a transparent, on-chain process.
- **Polygon CDK**: Enables rollup deployers to integrate modular DAOs and EIP-1559-compatible treasury flows into sovereign chains.
- **OP Stack (Base, Optimism)**: While not redirecting basefee to treasuries, these systems implement custom fee splits via sequencer rewards governed by L2 tokenholder proposals.

These models validate Olympia DAO’s architecture as consistent with best practices for decentralized funding and EVM-aligned governance.

Olympia DAO also draws technical inspiration from mature, battle-tested governance frameworks that have governed significant on-chain treasuries and evolved with ecosystem best practices:

- **Aragon OSx (used by Lido DAO)**: A modular and upgradeable DAO stack that enables fine-grained permission management and secure on-chain governance. Audited by Halborn and Code4rena, Aragon has secured billions in value for DAOs like Lido and API3. Its governance system supports proposal submission, on-chain voting, and treasury execution through customizable plugins.

- **Compound Governor Bravo**: The second-generation governance system for Compound Finance. It introduced configurable voting delays, thresholds, and quorum requirements. Widely used and audited, Bravo enables token-weighted proposal flows with timelock-enforced execution.

- **OpenZeppelin Governor**: A modular governance contract suite that mirrors Compound's model but allows flexible integration of voting modules (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721, veTokens). OpenZeppelin Governor contracts are audited and form the backbone of many DAO deployments due to their composability and clarity.

- **Aave DAO Governance Framework**: Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs) follow a token-weighted voting process with configurable thresholds, followed by execution via audited TimelockExecutors. Aave’s DAO system has governed multibillion-dollar treasuries and introduced cross-chain governance extensions with timelock safety.

These frameworks validate Olympia DAO’s architecture by demonstrating secure, upgradable systems that support open participation, transparent execution, and scalable governance logic. Olympia DAO adapts these principles to Ethereum Classic’s unique Proof-of-Work and immutability guarantees.

### Implementation

The Olympia DAO governance system will be implemented as a modular set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum Classic, designed to interact directly with the Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112). The system includes the following components:

#### 1. **Governor Contract**
- Core logic for proposal submission, voting, and execution.
- Inspired by battle-tested frameworks like:
  - [OpenZeppelin Governor](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/governance)
  - [Compound Governor Bravo](https://github.com/compound-finance/governance)
- Customizable parameters such as:
  - Proposal threshold
  - Voting delay and period
  - Quorum requirements
  - Timelock delay for execution

#### 2. **Timelock Contract**
- Acts as a secure buffer between successful proposals and fund disbursement.
- Enforces a delay before execution to allow for public review or veto mechanisms.
- Prevents rushed or malicious proposal execution.

#### 3. **Voting Mechanism**
- Token-based voting using ERC-20-compatible vote tokens (e.g., `gETC`, `veOLY`).
- Quadratic or delegated voting MAY be supported depending on governance evolution.
- Voter snapshots are taken at the block in which the proposal is submitted.

#### 4. **Proposal Registry and Metadata**
- On-chain metadata pointers (e.g., IPFS, Arweave) for human-readable proposal details.
- Off-chain discussion platforms (e.g., ECIP forums, Discord) used for proposal deliberation.

#### 5. **Integration with Olympia Treasury**
- Upon successful vote and timelock delay, the DAO contract will call the `execute()` or `release()` function of the Olympia Treasury contract to disburse funds.
- All executed disbursements MUST emit a `ProposalExecuted` event from both the DAO and Treasury contracts.

All contracts will be published open-source and audited before mainnet deployment. A phased testnet rollout on Mordor will be used to validate system integrity, voting behavior, and treasury integration prior to production use.

Governance parameters may be initialized with conservative defaults and adjusted via governance vote once live.

While the Olympia DAO operates entirely on-chain for governance, voting, and proposal execution, an external legal interface is provided through the Ethereum Classic DAO LLC (see ECIP-1114). This Wyoming-registered entity facilitates real-world compliance tasks such as fiat conversion, tax reporting, and contractor onboarding. It does not hold treasury funds or possess decision-making authority. Instead, it acts solely as a compliance and execution layer for off-chain disbursements authorized by DAO governance.

### Decoupled Governance Deployment

The Olympia DAO is intentionally designed to be deployed independently of the initial treasury activation. ECIP-1113 may be implemented after ECIP-1111 and ECIP-1112 have gone live, enabling the treasury to passively accumulate protocol revenue while governance infrastructure undergoes audit, testnet deployment, and stakeholder onboarding.

This decoupling allows for a safer and more iterative rollout. No funds can be disbursed until the DAO is live and the relevant proposal mechanisms are functional. Community members can track treasury accumulation and verify contract behavior prior to governance activation.

### Backwards Compatibility

The Olympia DAO governance system is a new protocol layer and does not alter the Ethereum Classic virtual machine, consensus rules, or transaction formats. As such, it is fully backward-compatible with all existing smart contracts, wallets, and tooling.

Participation in governance is opt-in. Only users who wish to vote, submit proposals, or interact with the treasury need to engage with the DAO contracts.

Key backward compatibility notes:

- The Olympia DAO contracts do not impact non-participating dApps or users.
- The Olympia Treasury (ECIP-1112) will only disburse funds through governance-approved proposals.
- Legacy transactions and contracts will remain fully functional and are unaffected by DAO operations.
- Nodes that do not upgrade to include the Olympia Treasury or ECIP-1111 logic will diverge from consensus, but nodes that do not interact with the DAO specifically will remain compatible.

Because the DAO system exists entirely at the smart contract level, its deployment poses no risk to prior state or core protocol functionality.

### Security Considerations

The Olympia DAO introduces a governance layer that must be designed with strong safeguards to prevent abuse, mismanagement, or centralization. Key security considerations include:

- **Governance Capture**: If a single actor or small group acquires majority voting power (e.g. via token delegation), they could push through malicious proposals. Mitigations include quorum thresholds, delayed execution, and dynamic participation incentives.

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: All DAO contracts must undergo rigorous audits and formal verification. Governance logic should avoid complex branching logic or unsafe delegatecall patterns.

- **Proposal Spam & Denial of Service**: To prevent spam, proposal submission may include minimal thresholds such as time-locks, token staking, or vetting periods. DAO design should protect against front-running or griefing of active proposals.

- **Funds Misallocation**: The DAO must enforce strict execution paths that only allow funds to be released to externally validated proposals, minimizing the chance of accidental or fraudulent disbursements.

- **Treasury Safeguards**: The Olympia Treasury contract MUST NOT allow direct EOA withdrawals. All transfers must be triggered through verified governance execution paths to ensure full auditability.

- **Upgradability Risks**: If the governance system is designed to be upgradeable, those upgrade paths must themselves be subject to governance approval and time-locked delay to prevent hostile takeovers.

- **Client Divergence**: Clients must verify that governance-triggered treasury withdrawals match the approved proposals. Inconsistencies between governance execution and treasury state could lead to consensus-breaking behavior.

- **Upgradeability and Treasury Integrity**:  
  While the Olympia DAO is designed for modular upgradeability to support evolving governance mechanisms, this flexibility does not extend to the treasury itself. The Olympia Treasury contract is immutable, and cannot be upgraded, withdrawn from, or modified — even by future DAO proposals. DAO upgrades are limited to governance logic only and must pass full proposal review, quorum, and timelock procedures.

  This architectural separation ensures that no future DAO, governance token holder, or developer can unilaterally seize or misallocate protocol funds. Treasury disbursement always requires an on-chain governance proposal, public scrutiny, and time-locked execution via secure interfaces.

- **Governance Inactivity or Capture**:  
  To mitigate long-term governance stagnation or tokenholder collusion, the DAO MAY authorize a time-limited fallback multisig capable of pausing execution and initiating recovery proposals. This multisig MUST be elected, transparent, and auditable, with no treasury withdrawal privileges. Such a mechanism ensures governance continuity without compromising decentralization.

- **Token Premine Prevention**:  
  To prevent insider control or governance capture, no governance token is defined or distributed at launch. All token creation, including voting rights or delegation models, MUST be initiated via DAO proposal and subject to on-chain vote. This ensures neutrality and preserves ETC’s anti-premine ethos.

Thorough testing on Mordor Testnet, peer review from ecosystem participants, and third-party audits of the DAO and treasury contracts are critical before mainnet deployment.
